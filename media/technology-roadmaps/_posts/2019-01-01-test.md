To address our energy and climate change challenges, there is a need to accelerate research to deployment of energy and low carbon technologies in Singapore. To achieve this, NCCS and the National Research Foundation (NRF) have jointly commissioned a series of Technology Roadmaps. Many of these Roadmaps were informed by the Technology Primers developed earlier (see further below).

Each Roadmap highlights the research, development, demonstration and deployment (RDD&D) pathways for technologies that can help increase energy efficiency, lower carbon emissions and increase energy security for Singapore up to 2030 and beyond. The Roadmaps also identified and prioritised technologies and actions required to accelerate these technologies into the market place. With relevant Government agency(s) leading the effort, each Roadmap was developed in close consultation with various stakeholders within the Government, academia and industry. These roadmaps will guide government agencies in formulating technology master plans and funding initiatives to secure Singapore's energy future and address climate change challenges.
