### MSS CELEBRATES WORLD METEOROLOGICAL DAY 2012 WITH OPENING OF NEW UPPER AIR OBSERVATORY AND LAUNCH OF SINGAPORE'S FIRST BOOK ON LOCAL WEATHER

**Singapore, 23 March 2012** - Students, teachers and the general public will be able to better understand Singapore’s weather with The Weather and Climate of Singapore, a book written by Ms Micheline Fong, a senior meteorologist with the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS). Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, officially launches The Weather and Climate of Singapore at the new Upper Air Observatory as MSS celebrates World Meteorological Day 2012.

**Launch of The Weather and Climate of Singapore**

The Weather and Climate of Singapore is the first comprehensive publication to focus specifically on Singapore’s weather and climate. The 228-page book covers the weather systems we commonly experience, such as thunderstorms, “Sumatra” squalls and monsoon surges. Written with students, teachers and the general public in mind, the book explains the science of weather observations and predictions, as well as local climate statistics in an easy-to-understand manner. Exciting features on the monsoons, clouds, and the science of weather observation and prediction are presented in various interesting formats such as photographs, illustrations, graphs, and satellite images.

Recent extreme weather events serve as reminders of the growing importance of accurate weather and climate predictions and information. The launch of the book at a time where there is growing public interest in Singapore’s weather and climate serves to complement MSS’ intention to make available more comprehensive real-time data in the coming months.

“There are many aspects to the weather, and different weather phenomena that can be observed in Singapore,” said Micheline. “I hope people will feel that our weather is part of their ‘natural heritage’ and take pride in it”, she added.

**Opening of the Upper Air Observatory**

MSS also officially opens the Upper Air Observatory at 36 Kim Chuan Road.

The Upper Air Observatory (UAO) gathers meteorological observations of the atmosphere that are essential for weather monitoring and forecasting, and climate research. MSS’ UAO is part of a global network of about 1300 stations world-wide.

Twice daily measurements are carried out at the UAO through the releasing of balloon-borne meteorological sensors which measure wind, temperature, humidity and air pressure up to heights of 30 km or more.

The new UAO is equipped with improved facilities for the launching of weather balloons. It is housed in a new building with green features such as solar panels and a rain harvesting system that harvests rain water to irrigate the building’s landscape.

The Director-General of MSS, Ms Wong Chin Ling, said, “The opening of the new UAO marks a significant milestone for MSS which has been collecting upper air observations for the past 60 years. With the latest upper-air sounding system, Singapore will continue to contribute reliable, high quality observations to the international meteorological community for forecasting and research purposes.”

**World Meteorological Day 2012**

On 23 March 2012, MSS celebrates the World Meteorological Day together with 189 worldwide member states of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The theme for this year is “Powering our future with weather, climate and water”. According to Mr Michel Jarraud, the Secretary-General of the WMO, the theme “highlights the growing roles of weather, climate and water in powering a sustainable future”.
