### MINISTER VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN TO ATTEND MINISTERIAL MEETING ON CLIMATE CHANGE CONVENED BY INDIA, BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA AND CHINA IN NEW DELHI, INDIA, 14 FEBRUARY 2012

**Singapore, 13 February 2012** - Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, will attend a Ministerial Meeting on climate change convened jointly by India, Brazil, South Africa and China, (or BASIC), in New Delhi, India, on 14 February 2012. Dr Balakrishnan’s attendance is at the invitation of Indian Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Environment & Forests, Jayanthi Natarajan.

Brazil, South Africa, India, and China collectively form a grouping called BASIC which takes positions in international climate change negotiations. The BASIC Ministerial Meeting on climate change takes place regularly and brings together ministers from the BASIC countries to discuss issues in international climate change negotiations. While not a member of the BASIC, Singapore has been invited along with other non-members to attend the meeting as an observer.

The objective of the upcoming meeting is to discuss issues arising from the international climate change conference held in Durban, South Africa, in December 2011, as well as the preparations needed for the next conference to be held in Qatar in December 2012.
