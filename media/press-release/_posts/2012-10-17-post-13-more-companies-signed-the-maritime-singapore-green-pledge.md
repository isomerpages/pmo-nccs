### 13 MORE COMPANIES SIGNED THE MARITIME SINGAPORE GREEN PLEDGE

**Singapore, 17 October 2012**  - The Maritime Singapore Green Pledge continues to receive positive response from the maritime industry as another 13 organisations came together today to sign the Maritime Singapore Green Pledge during the opening ceremony of the 17th Singapore International Bunkering Conference and Exhibition (SIBCON).

This is the third Green Pledge signing ceremony organised by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) since the Green Pledge was inaugurated in April 2011. With the latest signing, a total of 40 key organisations have pledged their commitment to promote clean and green shipping in Singapore.

Mr Lam Yi Young, Chief Executive of MPA said, "We started the Green Pledge last year as part of the Maritime Singapore Green Initiative. Through the Green Pledge, we want to encourage the maritime industry to come forward and play an active role in promoting clean and green shipping in Singapore. We are heartened by the continued support for the Maritime Singapore Green Initiative and the Maritime Singapore Green Pledge."

The 13 new signatories of the Green Pledge are listed in Annex A. The signatories pledged to be responsible members of the international maritime community by supporting and promoting clean and green shipping in Singapore, and called upon the maritime community to join them in protecting and safeguarding the environment.

**Update on the Maritime Singapore Green Initiative**

The Maritime Singapore Green Initiative was launched by MPA during Singapore Maritime Week 2011 to reduce the environmental impact of shipping and related activities and to promote clean and green shipping in Singapore. It is a comprehensive initiative comprising three programmes – Green Ship Programme, Green Port Programme and Green Technology Programme. MPA pledged to invest up to $100 million over a period of five years in the Maritime Singapore Green Initiative. The initiative was implemented since Jul 2011.

The Green Ship Programme targets Singapore-flagged ships and encourages the use of efficient ship designs that reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Singapore-flagged ships which go beyond the requirements of the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Energy Efficiency Design Index will enjoy a 50 per cent reduction of Initial Registration Fees (IRF) and a 20 per cent rebate on Annual Tonnage Tax (ATT) payable. To-date, 28 ships have qualified for the Green Ship Programme.

The Green Port Programme aims to encourage ocean-going ships calling at the Port of Singapore to reduce the emission of pollutants. Ships that use type-approved abatement/ scrubber technology or clean fuels with sulphur content of less than 1 per cent m/m during their entire port stay (five days or less) can enjoy a 15 per cent concession in port dues. As of 30 September 2012, a total of 369 vessels have registered in this programme and 742 vessel calls have enjoyed the 15 per cent concession in port dues.

The Green Technology Programme aims to encourage local maritime companies to develop and adopt green technologies through co-funding of up to half of qualifying costs. MPA has set aside an initial $25 million from the Maritime Innovation and Technology (MINT) Fund for this programme. To-date, 10 projects from nine maritime companies have received support from this programme. Total approved funding support from MPA for these projects is $7.7 million.
