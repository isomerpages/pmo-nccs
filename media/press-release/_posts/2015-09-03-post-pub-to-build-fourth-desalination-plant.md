### PUB TO BUILD FOURTH DESALINATION PLANT

*Singapore’s latest desalination plant in Marina East will help meet water demand in the city area and strengthen Singapore’s drought resilience.*

**Singapore, 3 September 2015** - National water agency PUB today announced that it will call a tender for the provision of Consultancy Services for Singapore’s fourth desalination plant. Planned with a capacity of 30 million imperial gallons per day (mgd), the plant will help meet future water demand in the city area and strengthen Singapore’s drought resilience.

Located near water demand zones in the city and eastern Singapore, the Marina East desalination plant will also have the capability to treat freshwater from Marina Reservoir.

Chua Soon Guan, Deputy Chief Executive (Policy & Development), said, “PUB has been making investments to build up and diversify our water supply sources in order to strengthen our water security. During the dry weather in recent years, we were able to ensure supply by increasing the production of NEWater and desalinated water. Building up weather-resilient water sources will help us be better prepared for possible prolonged periods of dry spells in future.”

The tender will include the engineering design for the development of the plant under a Design-Build-Own-Operate (DBOO) arrangement.
