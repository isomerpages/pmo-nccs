### NEW NATIONAL TECHNOLOGY ROADMAPS TO ADDRESS ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE CHALLENGES UNVEILED AT ENERGY INNOVATION 2016

The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) and the National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, unveiled three new national energy technology roadmaps at Energy Innovation 2016. Co-organised by NCCS, NRF and the Energy Market Authority (EMA), the event is a forum for industry representatives, government agencies, academics and researchers to discuss how Singapore’s future energy needs could be secured through technological innovation.

The energy technology roadmaps are part of efforts under the Energy National Innovation Challenge (ENIC) announced in 2011 to harness Singapore’s R&D base to raise energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions and increase energy options. The roadmaps guide the development of technology master plans by government agencies and formulation of funding initiatives for the Urban Solutions and Sustainability domain under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2020 Plan<sup>[1]</sup>.

Developed in collaboration with industry stakeholders, academic experts and technical consultants, the roadmaps are led by public agencies and cover the following 
technology areas:

Professor Low Teck Seng, CEO, NRF said in his opening remarks at Energy Innovation 2016: “The technology roadmaps that we are sharing today are one of the critical tools in our strategy to understand global technological trends. They highlight the research and development priorities for Singapore to develop the energy solutions we need for tomorrow. We believe the roadmaps will help stakeholders evaluate their business options and direct their investments, sharpen their R&D strategies, as well as develop policy to facilitate high impact outcomes for Singapore.”

Mr Tang Tuck Weng, Senior Director, NCCS, said: “In support of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, Singapore has made a commitment to reduce our Emission Intensity by 36 per cent from the 2005 levels by 2030 and stabilise our emissions with the aim of peaking around the same time. This is an ambitious goal given Singapore’s limited renewable energy options. New technology that can improve energy efficiency and decrease our dependence on fossil fuels is thus a critical area that the Government is looking at. We are optimistic that the new roadmaps will spur research, development, demonstration and deployment of urban solutions that contribute towards our goal of addressing climate change and building a sustainable Singapore.”

<sup>[1]</sup> Under the sixth science and technology plan for Singapore - the RIE2020 Plan - the government has committed $19 billion, over the next five years (2016 to 2020), to support and translate research, build up the innovation capacity of our companies to drive economic growth, and leverage science and technology to address national challenges. In RIE2020, the Urban Solutions and Sustainability domain seeks to develop a sustainable and liveable city through integrated solutions in energy, water and land for Singapore and the world.

**About the National Climate Change Secretariat**

The NCCS was set up as a dedicated agency under the Prime Minister’s Office on 1 July 2010 to coordinate Singapore’s domestic and international policies, plans and actions on climate change so as to secure a sustainable living environment for our future generations. NCCS will achieve this by adopting a Whole-of-Government approach and working with the People and Private sectors to devise and implement cost-effective mitigation and adaptation solutions, reap the opportunities arising from addressing climate change challenges and contribute towards global efforts to address climate change.

**National Research Foundation, Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore**

The National Research Foundation (NRF) is a department within the Prime Minister's Office. The NRF sets the national direction for research, innovation and enterprise (RIE) in Singapore. It seeks to invest in science, technology and engineering, build up the technological capacity of our companies, encourage innovation by industry to exploit new opportunities that drive economic growth, and facilitate public-private partnerships to address national challenges.

Under RIE2020, NRF is committed to create greater value in Singapore from our investment in research, innovation and enterprise through 1) closer integration of research thrusts, 2) stronger dynamic towards the best teams and ideas, 3) sharper focus on value creation, and 4) better optimised RIE manpower.
