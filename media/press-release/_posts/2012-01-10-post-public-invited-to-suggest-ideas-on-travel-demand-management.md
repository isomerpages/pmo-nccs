### PUBLIC INVITED TO SUGGEST IDEAS ON TRAVEL DEMAND MANAGEMENT

* Enhanced on 10 October 2011, SMRT Early Travel Discount scheme encourages travel on
SMRT's rail lines during morning off-peak hours. Commuters are given a discount of up to 30-
cents off their fares if they start their journeys from the North-South East-West Lines and
Bukit Panjang LRT stations and exit from nine city stations (Lavender, Bugis, City Hall, Raffles
Place, Tanjong Pagar, Outram Park, Dhoby Ghaut, Somerset and Orchard) before 7.45am, 
Mondays to Saturdays (excluding public holidays).

* SMRT is currently monitoring the take-up rate of the scheme. Public can log into
[<a href="http://www.smrt.com.sg/" target="_blank">www.smrt.com.sg</a>](http://www.smrt.com.sg/) for more information.

5. The results of the INSINC study and the SMRT scheme will allow LTA to evaluate the effectiveness of such demand management programmes/incentives. Public feedback on these schemes will also provide useful information and ideas for LTA to look at how these schemes can be refined to make it more effective in spreading out the peak period crowdedness.
