### CLEANTECH ONE OFFICIALLY OPENS TO CATALYSE CLEANTECH GROWTH

**Singapore, 15 August 2013** - JTC Corporation's (JTC) CleanTech One, the first development at CleanTech Park, was officially opened by Minister for Trade & Industry Mr Lim Hng Kiang this morning.

The Green Mark Platinum 6-storey, 37,500-sqm CleanTech One provides specialized business park, laboratory and office space for key local and international cleantech-related organizations to form a vibrant cleantech ecosystem in CleanTech Park. The Park is located next to the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), which is set to promote the cross-fertilisation of knowledge and ideas between academia and industry.

Dr Loo Choon Yong, JTC's Chairman said, "CleanTech Park's location at the forefront of the largest manufacturing node in Singapore, comprising Jurong Industrial Estate and Tuas, provides a strategic linkage between academia and business. This linkage will enable cleantech research to be translated into industry-relevant applications."

The co-location of businesses, practitioners and academia seeks to catalyze innovation in cleantech research through the formation of strategic alliances within the CleanTech Park community.

Nanyang Technological University Professor Ng Wun Jern, Executive Director of the Nanyang Environment & Water Research Institute (NEWRI), a key tenant in CleanTech One, said, "Having like-minded professionals from academia and businesses under the same roof at CleanTech One is an invaluable opportunity for fruitful collaborative exchanges. These exchanges help to ensure that our pursuit of green solutions stays industry-relevant and practical.

With a strong representation of cleantech R&D and businesses, CleanTech One is well placed to serve as a living laboratory to test-bed and showcase yet-to-be-commercialised innovative solutions. Since the launch of the CleanTech Park Living Lab Programme in 2011, JTC has funded 14 test-bed projects. Examples of resource-efficient urban solutions being test-bedded include a 1-megawatt fuel cell plant that is being implemented by Real Time Engineering, a local SME and a tenant and partner of JTC.

"Environmental sustainability has become a strategic imperative for many global companies. Recognising this trend, EDB and JTC are developing the clean technology industry as a key growth area and positioning itself as the Asian epicentre for companies to develop, test and commercialise innovative sustainability solutions. CleanTech Park plays a vital role in catalysing partnerships between the solution providers, end-users and research ecosystem." said Mr Yeoh Keat Chuan, Managing Director of the Singapore Economic Development Board.

Recognizing the value proposition of CleanTech One, President and Group Chief Executive Officer of energy solutions company Diamond Energy Mr Dallon Kay said, "JTC's openness to experimental research work and their willingness to consider the adoption and deployment of new technologies was one of the main reasons that attracted Diamond Energy to relocate its Demand Response Operations Center to CleanTech One. Here, SMEs have the opportunity to partner world class research institutes to advance their development of cleantech solutions."
