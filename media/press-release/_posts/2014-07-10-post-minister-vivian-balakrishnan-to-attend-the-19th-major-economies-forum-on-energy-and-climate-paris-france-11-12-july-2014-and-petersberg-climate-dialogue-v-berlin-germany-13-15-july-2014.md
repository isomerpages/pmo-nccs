### MINISTER VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN TO ATTEND THE 19TH MAJOR ECONOMIES FORUM ON ENERGY AND CLIMATE, PARIS, FRANCE, 11-12 JULY 2014; AND PETERSBERG CLIMATE DIALOGUE V, BERLIN, GERMANY, 13-15 JULY 2014

Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Dr Vivian Balakrishnan will attend the 19th Major Economies Forum (MEF) on Energy and Climate in Paris, France, on 11 and 12 July 2014, and the Petersberg Climate Dialogue V in Berlin, Germany, from 13 to 15 July 2014.

Initiated in 2009 by the United States, the MEF brings together 17 major economies to discuss matters related to the international climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC). This upcoming meeting will be co-hosted by the United States and France, and will discuss issues related to the new global climate change agreement which is set to be adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP) and 11th Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) to be held in 2015 in Paris.

The Petersberg Climate Dialogue is an annual forum where Ministers from about 35 countries meet to exchange views on the international climate change negotiations. The Dialogue will be co-hosted by Germany and Peru, and will serve as a preparatory meeting for the 20th COP and 10th CMP in Lima that will be hosted by Peru in December 2014.
