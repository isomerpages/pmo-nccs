### SINGAPORE UNVEILS NATIONAL TECHNOLOGY ROADMAPS TO ADDRESS ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE CHALLENGES

**Singapore, 30 July 2014** - The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) and the National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, unveiled today five national energy technology roadmaps that will guide government agencies in formulating their technology master plans and funding initiatives to secure Singapore's energy future and address climate change challenges.

The energy technology roadmaps are part of efforts under the Energy National Innovation Challenge (ENIC) announced in 2011 to bring significant changes to Singapore's energy landscape in a whole-of-government effort. The goals of the ENIC are to develop cost-competitive energy solutions that can be deployed within 20 years to improve Singapore's energy efficiency, reduce its carbon emissions and broaden its energy options to sustain economic growth.

Developed in collaboration with industry stakeholders, academic experts and technical consultants, the roadmaps[1] are led by public agencies and cover the following technology areas:

National Environment Agency (NEA), EDB

As part of follow-up to the technology roadmapping exercise, two major energy R&D initiatives, namely the Building Energy Efficiency RD&D Hub to be implemented and managed by BCA and the Green Data Centre Research Hub Programme to be managed by IDA will receive funding totalling $100 million.

Development of the national technology roadmaps is an on-going effort. Two new roadmaps are currently in the pipeline - the Electro-mobility (E-mobility) Roadmap and the Solid Waste Management Roadmap led by the Land Transport Authority and the NEA respectively.

**Energy Technology Roadmap Symposium**

An inaugural symposium, the Energy TechRoadMap 2014, was held today to discuss the findings and recommendations of the five technology roadmaps ([<a href="/docs/default-source/news-documents/techroadmap_annexa_20140730.pdf" target="_blank">see Annex A</a>](/docs/default-source/news-documents/techroadmap_annexa_20140730.pdf)). Co-organised by the NCCS and NRF, the event was attended by over 700 participants from the public sector, academia, industry and non-governmental organisations, as well as international and local expert presenters and panellists.

Ms Yong Ying-I, Co-Chairman, Energy Research Development & Demonstration Executive Committee, Permanent Secretary (Public Service Division) and Permanent Secretary (National Research and Development), and Mr Niam Chiang Meng, Permanent Secretary (National Climate Change) and Permanent Secretary (National Population and Talent Division) were also present at the symposium, which discussed the carbon mitigation potential of key technologies and platforms for research, development, demonstration and deployment (RDD&D) in Singapore.
