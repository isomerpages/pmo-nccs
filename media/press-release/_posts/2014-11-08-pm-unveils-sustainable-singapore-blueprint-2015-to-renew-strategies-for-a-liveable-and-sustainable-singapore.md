### PM UNVEILS SUSTAINABLE SINGAPORE BLUEPRINT 2015 TO RENEW STRATEGIES FOR A LIVEABLE AND SUSTAINABLE SINGAPORE

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong unveiled today the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB) 2015, which outlines a national vision with new and bold plans to create a more liveable and sustainable future for Singaporeans â€“ where Singapore can continue to be an exceptional Home, City and Community. 

First released in 2009, the SSB maps out strategies for Singapore's sustainable development, ensuring that the country remains a highly liveable home for all. Singapore is on track to meet or exceed the 2020 and 2030 targets set out in 2009. (Refer to [<a href="/files/default-source/news-documents/annex-a---ssb-2009-targets-and-achievements.pdf" target="_blank">Annex A</a>](/files/default-source/news-documents/annex-a---ssb-2009-targets-and-achievements.pdf) for SSB 2009 targets and achievements). 

This year, the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources and the Ministry of National Development led a review of the SSB, which took stock of achievements over the last five years as well as the latest developments in Singapore and around the world. As part of this review, more than 6000 people from various stakeholder groups stepped forward to participate in public consultations and focus group discussions. 

The SSB 2015 will be guided by the vision of a Liveable and Endearing Home, a Vibrant and Sustainable City, and an Active and Gracious Community [1]. Building on the on-going efforts of various agencies, the programmes in the SSB 2015 will guide Singapore towards achieving the following outcomes (refer to [<a href="/files/default-source/news-documents/annex-b--highlights-of-ssb-2015-initiatives.pdf" target="_blank">Annex B</a>](/files/default-source/news-documents/annex-b--highlights-of-ssb-2015-initiatives.pdf) for Highlights of initiatives under each section): 

**1. "Eco-Smart" Endearing Towns**

As smart technology and eco-friendly features are embedded into our towns and homes, Singaporeans will enjoy greater convenience and a better quality of life. Enjoying time with family and friends will be easier with parks, ABC (Active, Beautiful, Clean) Waters projects, sports facilities, and other community amenities available nearby. A green lifestyle will be second nature for many, with more ways for people to conserve energy and water and keep their environment clean and fresh, starting in their homes. Convenient recycling facilities will enable residents to segregate their waste easily while keeping our town's environment pleasant and pest-free;

**2. "A "Car-Lite" Singapore**

With a denser rail network and extensive bus services, we will be able to travel seamlessly and efficiently around Singapore. Cycling and walking will also become popular forms of getting around in our neighbourhoods and beyond. With a "car-lite" Singapore, we can reduce our carbon footprint, enjoy fresher air, a cleaner environment, and a healthier lifestyle;

**3. Towards a Zero Waste Nation**

We will work towards becoming a Zero Waste Nation by reducing our consumption, and reusing and recycling all materials to give them a second lease of life. The Government, the community, and businesses will come together to put in place infrastructure and programmes to make this our way of life. Together, we will keep Singapore clean and healthy, conserve precious resources, and free up land for more meaningful uses for our future generations to enjoy;

**4. A Leading Green Economy**

Our businesses will be encouraged to adopt greener practices, Singapore will be a hub for the cutting-edge business of sustainable development, and Singaporeans can enjoy jobs in this exciting and meaningful sector. We will create living labs to test-bed ideas that improve lives and are good for the environment. We aim to raise solar penetration rates as well as to grow our capability in green buildings. Businesses in Singapore will be internationally renowned for doing well by doing good; and

**5. An Active and Gracious Community**

Singaporeans are at the heart of the Blueprint. We and our children are the beneficiaries of its outcomes. However our own efforts and commitment today are central to securing the vision laid out in the Blueprint. Singaporeans must become exemplary stewards of our environment. We must participate in shaping our neighbourhoods, and build a more gracious society together as a community. It should be second nature for everyone to come together to care for our common spaces and environment, take a long-term perspective in conserving precious resources, and champion a sustainable way of life. A clean and green Singapore can only be meaningfully achieved by Singaporeans so that Singapore can be an exceptional home for them and their families and indeed, for many generations to come.

To achieve its desired targets, the Government will commit $1.5 billion to support the roll out of the programmes and initiatives contained in the SSB 2015 by the various government agencies.
