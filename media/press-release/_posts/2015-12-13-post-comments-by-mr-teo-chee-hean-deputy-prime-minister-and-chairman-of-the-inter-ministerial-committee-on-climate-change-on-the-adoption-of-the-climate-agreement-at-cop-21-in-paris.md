### COMMENTS BY MR TEO CHEE HEAN, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND CHAIRMAN OF THE INTER-MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE, ON THE ADOPTION OF THE CLIMATE AGREEMENT AT COP-21 IN PARIS

"Singapore welcomes the adoption of the historic Paris climate agreement. It is a fair and comprehensive agreement, where all parties will take action to tackle this key issue of climate change that affects the future of the global community. The agreement shows how with goodwill, commitment and willingness to look beyond individual concerns, cooperation among all countries is possible for the global larger, long-term good.

Every country, large or small, developed or developing, has a part to play.

We are honoured that Singapore has contributed to the success of the talks. Our Ministers and officials have done well by playing the role of an honest broker, to help reach agreement on difficult issues.

With the agreement adopted, Singapore will work towards our pledge to reduce our emissions intensity by 36 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, and to stabilise our emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030."
