<p><strong>First-of-its-kind government coalition to issue shared principles on carbon credit use by COP30 to boost climate finance</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Governments of Kenya, Singapore, and the United Kingdom today announced
the creation of The Coalition to Grow Carbon Markets, a first-of-a-kind
government-led initiative to strengthen voluntary demand for carbon credits.</p>
<p>A thriving carbon market will unlock finance to support the decarbonisation
and sustainable development agendas of Emerging Markets and Developing
Economies (EMDEs), which is critical to meeting global climate goals.</p>
<p>The Coalition comprises ambitious governments committed to advancing climate
action through credible business use of high-integrity carbon credits alongside
deep corporate decarbonisation. The Coalition is co-chaired by Ali Mohamed,
Kenya Special Climate Envoy; Ravi Menon, Singapore Ambassador for Climate
Action; and Rachel Kyte, UK Special Representative for Climate.</p>
<p>France and Panama are founding members of this coalition of ambitious
governments committed to advancing climate action through the credible
use of high-integrity carbon credits. The Coalition will expand over the
coming months to include countries which are sources of demand for carbon
credits as well as countries which are sources of supply of credits. The
Government of Peru has already endorsed the Coalition’s mission, recognising
the critical role of carbon markets and corporate use of carbon credits
in delivering climate-positive growth globally.</p>
<p>By COP30, the Coalition will deliver its first results by issuing a clear
set of shared principles on the voluntary use of high-integrity carbon
credits by businesses to provide consistency in approach across jurisdictions.
This is in response to calls from businesses for greater clarity from governments
on the use of carbon credits as part of corporate decarbonisation plans.
The shared principles will give businesses the confidence and incentives
they need to invest in a proven but underused climate financing tool and
continue to strengthen and scale carbon markets. The Coalition will work
closely with businesses, so that policies and incentives better respond
to business needs.</p>
<p>The principles will help to grow demand for high-integrity carbon credits,
thereby helping to increase the flow of climate finance to EMDEs, by better
reflecting the true value of emissions reductions and removals being delivered.
This will boost investment in climate-positive businesses, sustainable
development and projects such as sustainable agriculture, clean energy,
as well as nature conservation and restoration.</p>
<p>The Coalition represents a bold new approach to mobilising essential private
sector investment to help close the USD$1.3 trillion climate finance gap
without adding to the debt burden. By boosting demand for high-integrity
credits, the market could expand to as much as USD$250 billion by 2050
in direct and leveraged finance to support climate action globally.</p>
<p>This move has also been welcomed by the International Chamber of Commerce
(ICC) as a response to calls from business for more cohesion and transparency,
and stronger, clearer incentives to engage with carbon markets. The ICC
and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) will
be partners to the Coalition, playing a critical role to ensure that its
work is informed by the needs, experiences and ambitions of global business.</p>
<p>In addition, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM),
an independent governance body which sets the global quality threshold
for the supply of credits in the voluntary carbon market through the Core
Carbon Principles, is also working with the Coalition to support seamless
alignment between the demand and supply sides of the market.</p>
<p>Carbon markets direct finance to projects that can cut emissions faster
and at lower cost. This helps modernise industries, cuts pollution, creates
employment opportunities, and delivers lasting benefits for local communities
and ecosystems. But reputational and legal risks, concerns about integrity
of supply, and lack of consistent guidance have stopped companies from
buying credits, even though they recognise the opportunity they offer to
deliver more rapid climate action at scale.</p>
<p>The Coalition will build on the progress made on Article 6 at COP29, and
high-integrity supply frameworks such as the Integrity Council for the
Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM)’s Core Carbon Principles starting to shape
the market. There is a clear role for Governments now to align, through
the Coalition, to support a level playing field and the high integrity
scaling of voluntary market use.</p>

<p><strong>QUOTES</strong>
</p>
<p>“To help unlock private sector finance at the scale and pace needed to
support global climate ambitions, we must energise the carbon markets.
This Coalition will help foster investor and stakeholder confidence, and
strengthen the integrity and interoperability of these markets while delivering
real emissions reductions. Singapore will play a meaningful role in catalysing
the development of the voluntary carbon market as a financial and services
hub, and through our investments in impactful decarbonisation projects
globally,” said <strong>Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, Singapore.</strong>
</p>
<p>“The UK is championing the responsible use of carbon credits by taking
action to spearhead global efforts to raise integrity, supporting UK businesses
to grow these markets and delivering growth through the Plan for Change.
Through this new Coalition, we’re giving businesses the clarity they need
to invest in high-integrity credits that drive real impact for climate
and nature,unlocking carbon markets as a trusted tool in accelerating towards
net zero," said <strong>Kerry McCarthy MP, Minister for Climate, UK Government.</strong>
</p>
<p>“Kenya's leadership in this Coalition reflects our commitment to transforming
how climate finance reaches developing nations. By boosting demand for
high-integrity credits, the market could expand to as much as $250 billion
by 2050 in direct and leveraged finance, supporting global climate action,
particularly through transformative projects in developing countries.”
said <strong>Ali Mohamed, Kenya Special Climate Envoy and Co-Chair of the Coalition to Grow Carbon Markets.</strong>
</p>
<p>"This new Coalition is a welcome response to the clear call from the global
business community to bring clarity, build confidence and integrity for
carbon credit buyers, and to scale incentives that reward real climate
action.</p>
<p>High-integrity carbon markets are a vital—but still underused—tool in
our climate arsenal. When done right, they empower businesses to cut emissions
faster, invest at scale, and accelerate the global transition to net zero.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement is more than a policy signal—it’s a commitment to
action. We commend this leadership and stand ready to support this Coalition
in unlocking the full potential of carbon markets for people, planet, and
prosperity," said <strong>Philippe Varin, Chair of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).</strong>
</p>
<p>“I am glad to announce that France is officially joining the Coalition
launched by the governments of Kenya, Singapore and the UK to support the
development of robust, credible and effective carbon markets.</p>
<p>This commitment is consistent with France's long-standing leadership on
climate action and advocacy for high-integrity carbon markets, which present
an untapped potential to increase corporate action and mobilize climate
finance where it is most cost effective.</p>
<p>As a Coalition, we can send a clear message to the market and bring the
needed clarity and confidence for investors. We are looking forward to
working in partnership with other governments to unlock the full potential
of carbon markets,” said <strong>Agnès Pannier-Runacher, Minister of Ecological Transition, Government of France.</strong>
</p>
<p>“I welcome this effort to provide greater clarity from governments on
corporate use of carbon credits to increase climate action. Social and
environmental integrity standards of carbon markets are vital to ensure
the public trust in this important instrument. Therefore, political leadership
is critical to building confidence and ambition, and we welcome this signal
of cooperation,” said <strong>Ana Toni, National Secretary for Climate Change at the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, Government of Brazil, and CEO of COP30.</strong>
</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Environment of Peru supports the Coalition’s effort to
foster a carbon market environment where integrity and high standards are
valued and recognized. We need to facilitate greater financial flows towards
mitigation activities and sustainable development, and we see this as a
promising foundation for strengthening global partnerships,” said <strong>Racquel Soto, Vice Minister of Strategic Development of Natural Resources, Government of Peru.</strong>
