<p>Singapore’s National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) in the Strategy
Group, Prime Minister’s Office and the world’s largest independent carbon
crediting programmes – Gold Standard and Verra – are working together to
develop an Article 6.2 Crediting Protocol (“Protocol”) aimed at supporting
countries in their use of Article 6 to achieve their Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs) and sustainable development goals.</p>
<p>Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement allows governments and private sector
participants to cooperate internationally through market-based mechanisms
to meet their climate targets. One option under Article 6.2 is for governments
to work through existing independent carbon crediting programmes, which
are already operational and widely used by market participants, to certify
their emission reductions and removals, thereby relieving them of the administrative
burden of having to develop their own approaches (e.g. standards for carbon
credits).</p>
<p>The intention for NCCS, Gold Standard and Verra to collaborate to create
standardised and streamlined procedures for governments to work with independent
carbon crediting programmes to implement Article 6.2 was first <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media/press-releases/singapore-verra-and-gold-standard-partner-to-develop-playbook-for-cc/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> at
COP28 in December 2023. In the absence of such a framework, countries could
take divergent approaches, which could hinder the implementation, scaling,
and integrity of cooperation under Article 6.2.</p>
<p>The initial recommendations set out key concepts and processes that will
form the basis of the Protocol, which will be further developed and published
in full following the conclusion of COP29. The report also includes recommendations
on how governments can facilitate a clear, efficient, and effective Article
6.2 market. The report also calls on governments to take steps to limit
regulatory and market risk associated with Article 6.2 transactions, for
example through robust templates for Letters of Authorisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development of the initial recommendations has been informed by engagements
with governments and other market experts over the past year. The final
Protocol will incorporate relevant decisions from COP29, with implementation
intended to start in 2025. The three organisations will continue to engage
and seek feedback from stakeholders when developing the final Protocol,
to ensure that it can serve as a practical enabler of and complement to
Article 6.2 rules adopted within the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>

<p><strong>Benedict Chia, Director-General (Climate Change), National Climate Change Secretariat, Singapore, said:&nbsp;</strong>“It
is important to have a protocol that facilitates Article 6.2 cooperation
between independent crediting programs and governments. This would ensure
that Article 6.2 can operate efficiently.”</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Kim, CEO of Gold Standard, said:&nbsp;</strong>“If a
market is to be trusted, it must be built on solid foundations. For Article
6 to be reliable and efficient, governments and standards need to work
together. These initial recommendations outline how, by doing so, they
can deliver impact for both the climate, and sustainable development.”</p>
<p><strong>Mandy Rambharos, CEO of Verra, said:</strong> “Independent crediting
programmes offer comprehensive standards and verification mechanisms that
are primed and ready for use by governments in their cooperation under
Article 6. The positive reactions we are already receiving from government
stakeholders demonstrate how independent standards, that have grown up
in the voluntary carbon market, have built a robust and credible foundation
that can seamlessly integrate into the infrastructure of compliance markets
and Article 6. Together, we can enable these new markets to be operational
and effective much more quickly than otherwise possible.”</p>
