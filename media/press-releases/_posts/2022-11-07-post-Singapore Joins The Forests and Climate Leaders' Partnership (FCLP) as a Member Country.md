Singapore has joined the Forests and Climate Leaders’ Partnership (FCLP) as a member country. The UK COP26 Presidency announced Singapore’s membership during the Forest and Climate Leaders’ Summit at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.

By joining the Partnership, Singapore commits to working with other Members and partners to develop high integrity markets for forestry carbon credits, while implementing innovative and environmentally robust solutions to reduce forest loss, increase restoration and support sustainable development. Our participation also builds upon Singapore’s commitments under the “Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use” (GLD) to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030.

Singapore’s participation in the FCLP is also aligned with our efforts in facilitating international acceptance of high-quality forestry carbon credits. We will explore how public-private partnerships can leverage carbon markets to unlock new revenue streams to cost effectively reduce emissions, while preserving nature and biodiversity. Singapore will also be participating in the inaugural FCLP meeting at COP27 on 12 November.

Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, Grace Fu, said “Singapore is delighted to be part of the Forest and Climate Leaders’ Partnership, to work with like-minded partners on innovative and environmentally robust solutions that would unlock the potential of the forestry sector for climate action, while reducing the loss of forests worldwide. The Partnership will help scale up and support the development of high integrity markets for forestry carbon credits, in advancing global climate ambition.”

Our participation reflects our commitment to collaborate with like-minded countries and partners to advance collective global climate action.
