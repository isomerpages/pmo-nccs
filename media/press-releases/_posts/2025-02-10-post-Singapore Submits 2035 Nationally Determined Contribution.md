<p>Singapore has committed to <strong>reduce emissions to between 45 and 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2035</strong> as
part of our 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)<sup>1</sup>,
which was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) earlier today. The 2035 NDC builds on our 2030 NDC and
paves the way to achieve our target of net zero emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>As a small low-lying island state, climate change is an existential challenge
for Singapore. Singapore’s 2035 NDC reflects both our commitment to climate
action, as well as the significant uncertainties we face in our decarbonisation
journey. The lower bound of 45 MtCO2e keeps us on a linear path to our
net zero target in 2050, in line with international expectations. The range
target takes into consideration the reality that as an alternative-energy
disadvantaged island state, Singapore’s pace of decarbonisation depends
heavily on developments in nascent mitigation technologies, and international
collaboration.</p>
<p>Singapore will continue to work on the range of mitigation measures available
to us and explore other mitigation options to drive further emissions reductions.
These solutions have the potential to grow the green economy, create jobs,
and generate new opportunities in a low-carbon world. Our 2035 NDC is an
ambitious target that signals to businesses our commitment to decarbonisation,
so that we may attract and catalyse economic opportunities for Singapore
in a low-carbon future.</p>
<p>Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee
Hean, Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change, will
elaborate on Singapore’s approach towards climate action and our 2035 NDC
at the Committee of Supply (COS) Debate 2025.</p>
<p>Singapore’s ambitious climate goals can only be realised with collective
action from the government, businesses, and people sector; everyone has
a role to play. We will continue our close engagement and partnership with
businesses and households to address concerns and co-create solutions.
This will help us better understand the decarbonisation options available
and how decarbonisation can bring long-term benefits to all of us, our
businesses and Singapore. Together, we can make good progress towards our
net zero target, capture emerging opportunities in the green economy, create
new good jobs, and build a more resilient future for generations of Singaporeans
to come.</p>
