Initiated in 2009 by the United States, the MEF brings together 17 major economies to discuss matters related to the international climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC). This upcoming meeting will be co-hosted by the United States and France, and will discuss issues related to the new global climate change agreement which is set to be adopted at the 21<sup>st</sup> Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP) and 11<sup>th</sup> Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) to be held in 2015 in Paris.

The Petersberg Climate Dialogue is an annual forum where Ministers from about 35 countries meet to exchange views on the international climate change negotiations. The Dialogue will be co-hosted by Germany and Peru, and will serve as a preparatory meeting for the 20<sup>th</sup>COP and 10<sup>th</sup> CMP in Lima that will be hosted by Peru in December 2014.
