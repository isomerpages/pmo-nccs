<p><strong>Singapore Will Contract High-Quality Nature-Based Carbon Credits From Four Projects In Ghana, Paraguay And Peru</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) and the Ministry of Trade
and Industry (MTI) will contract 2.175 million tonnes worth of high-quality
nature-based carbon credits from four projects in Ghana, Peru, and Paraguay.
This award is the result of a request for proposal (RFP) launched in September
2024 for nature-based carbon credits to meet Singapore’s 2030 Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Use of Article-6 carbon credits to meet decarbonisation targets</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Singapore aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and reduce emissions
to around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) by 2030
after peaking emissions earlier. We have introduced a carbon tax and are
investing in multiple decarbonisation pathways such as solar deployment,
renewable energy imports, and carbon capture and storage. However, as a
small, densely populated, island city-state with limited natural resources,
Singapore’s ability to fully decarbonise our economy is constrained.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The use of carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement provides
a viable and effective complementary pathway for countries such as Singapore
to achieve our decarbonisation targets, while pursuing all other feasible
decarbonisation pathways. Singapore’s supply of Article 6-compliant carbon
credits will come from taxable facilities<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, as well as direct procurement by the
Singapore Government. A second RFP for such Article 6-compliant carbon
credits will be launched later this year. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Article 6 carbon credits can be a catalyst to unlock green growth opportunities.
Singapore is now home to around 150 companies in the carbon services and
trading sector, operating in areas such as carbon trading, carbon advisory,
project development, financing, monitoring, reporting, and verification.
The Singapore Government will continue to facilitate opportunities for
Singapore-based companies to capture value in the emerging area of carbon
markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Selection of Nature-Based Projects</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nature-based solutions (NBS) globally have the potential to offer net emissions
reductions equivalent to more than 10 gigatons of carbon dioxide per year
<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup>
</a>. Through the RFP launched in September 2024, the Singapore Government
sought to identify projects from around the world that could generate high-quality
NBS carbon credits with high environmental integrity. Key features of these
projects include ensuring additionality<a href="#_ftn3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, low leakage risks, permanence, and co-benefits
to surrounding communities.</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As a result of this RFP, Singapore has decided to contract NBS carbon credits
from four NBS projects, namely the Kowen Antami REDD+<a href="#_ftn4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and
Together for Forests REDD+ projects in Peru, the Grassland Restoration
Project in Paraguay, and the Kwahu Landscape Restoration Project in Ghana.
&nbsp;We will contract to procure carbon credits equivalent to emissions
reductions of 2,175,000 tonnes of CO2, at a value of around S$76 million,
for use across 2026 to 2030.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These projects aim to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation, increase
carbon sequestration of soil organic carbon stock in grasslands through
sustainable management practices, and remove carbon emissions through the
reforestation of degraded pastureland. Carbon credits help to channel funds
towards the preservation or regeneration of host countries’ natural carbon
sinks and biodiversity, safeguard local communities’ access to income from
sustainable land use and provide ecosystem benefits such as improving water
quality. &nbsp;The projects have been selected based on the quality of
the proposal, the tenderer's track record, and price competitiveness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contracted
projects must use methodologies<a href="#_ftn5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[5]</sup></a><sup> </sup>bilaterally agreed to by Singapore
and the respective host country, and secure authorisation under the relevant
government-to-government Implementation Agreement (IA)<a href="#_ftn6" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[6]</sup></a>. To
date, Singapore has signed eight implementation agreements (IAs) with Bhutan,
Chile, Ghana, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Paraguay, Rwanda, and Thailand. Under
each of the Article 6 IAs, Singapore is committed to channeling the value
equivalent to 5% of the share of proceeds from authorised carbon credits
towards climate adaptation measures of the respective host countries.</p>

<p><strong><u>Annex – Description of Projects</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>VCS 5395: Kowen Antami REDD+ (Peru)</strong>. The Kowen Antami
REDD+ Project aims to protect the Yanachaga Chemillén National Park (PNYCH)
and the San Matías–San Carlos Protection Forest (BPSMSC). Protection of
these two areas has been challenging due to the expansion of both commercial
and small-scale agriculture, construction of new roads and wildfires in
and around the project area, resulting in extensive deforestation. The
project will introduce indigenous community-led activities aimed at mitigating
and reducing deforestation and forest degradation in a manner that improves
livelihoods and enhances governance.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>VCS 5442: Together for Forests REDD+ (Peru).</strong> The project
aims to reduce deforestation within the Project Area in three provinces
within the Madre De Dios region of Peru, which comprises forest concessions
and smallholder forest properties. The project aims to do so by securing
land tenure and providing the participating forest owners with resources
and offering them incentives to reduce deforestation. New initiatives under
the project include implementation of an early warning system to enhance
monitoring of illegal deforestation prevalent in the region; improved management
of forests by providing technical assistance on sustainable harvesting
techniques, enabling access to markets, promoting biodiversity conservation;
and the development of agroforestry systems which produce a diversity of
products and services that can be certified as 'deforestation free’.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VCS 3291 Grassland Restoration Project through Soil Enrichment (Paraguay).</strong>
</p>
<p>South American grasslands, including in Paraguay, are unique natural habitats
that provide important ecological and economic benefits. Livestock production
is the key livelihood activity in the region, which has led to overgrazing
and unsustainable grassland management, resulting in the decline of soil
organic carbon stock.&nbsp; To address this, the project aims to introduce
sustainable management practices in ranches across the Pampas Grasslands
in Paraguay to increase soil organic carbon stock.&nbsp;The primary project&nbsp;activity
is rotational grazing, while secondary activities include livestock management,
water conservation and management, forage management, controlled burning,
and capacity building programmes.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>VCS 5432 Kwahu Landscape Restoration Project (Ghana).</strong>
</p>
<p>Ghana’s tropical forests had declined to less than 2 million hectares
due to extensive logging, devastation by bushfires due to an increasing
land conversion to cocoa farms or other agricultural uses. Concurrently,
cocoa farmers were encouraged to remove native shade trees from their farms
to increase production. To address this, the 40-year ARR project located
in Ghana's Kwahu region, aims to restore 51kha of degraded lands, through
direct polyculture planting, agroforestry and regenerative planting practices
of native species. The project aims to sequester up to 33.5 million tCO2e
over its lifetime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a> Since
2024, under Singapore’s International Carbon Credit (ICC) framework, taxable
facilities in Singapore are allowed to use eligible ICCs to offset up to
5% of their taxable emissions.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[3]</a> Certified
emissions reductions or removals exceeding that required by any law or
regulatory requirement of the host country, and that would otherwise have
occurred in a conservative, business-as-usual scenario.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[4]</a> REDD+
refers to “Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation,
plus the conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement
of forest carbon stocks”,&nbsp;a framework developed under the Paris Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[5]</a> Three
of these projects intend to use methodologies under Verra’s Verified Carbon
Standards, namely VM0047 (Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation)
and VM0048 (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation).
Under the Paris Agreement Article 6.2 approach and within signed Implementation
Agreements, both Singapore and the host countries will need to whitelist
these methodologies, including any additional environmental integrity (EI)
safeguards. The fourth project adheres to VM0042 (Improved Agricultural
Management), which is on Singapore’s Eligibility List and will similarly
be go through whitelisting with host countries.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref6" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[6]</a> The
eligibility list may differ across IAs, as each host country has their
own priority mitigation sectors and activities, typically based on their
conditional Nationally Determined Contribution measures, as well as other
domestic requirements and considerations. All methodologies must meet both
Singapore and the partner country’s Eligibility Criteria prior to being
listed.</p>
