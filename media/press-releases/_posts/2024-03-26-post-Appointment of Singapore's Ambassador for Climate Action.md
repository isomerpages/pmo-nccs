<p><strong>Appointment of Singapore's Ambassador for Climate Action</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Ravi Menon will be appointed as Singapore’s Ambassador for Climate
Action and Senior Adviser (National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS))
with effect from 1 April 2024.</p>
<p>Mr Menon, as Singapore’s first Ambassador for Climate Action, will play
a leading role in Singapore’s climate efforts domestically and beyond.
He will represent Singapore at international climate action platforms,
to contribute to global discourse and collective action. He will also drive
public-private partnerships with local stakeholders, in particular the
business community, to help them seize opportunities to succeed in a low-carbon
future. In addition, Mr Menon will advise NCCS On whole-of-government climate
policies and action.</p>
<p>Climate change is an existential threat to the world. Singapore is committed
to playing its part and has announced to achieve net zero emissions by
2050. Singapore will play an active role in fostering international collaboration
to catalyse global climate action, and will leverage our strengths as a
global hub to do so. Doing so, we also seek to capture new opportunities
for the Singapore economy.</p>
<p>Mr Menon was previously Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of
Singapore, where he helped to build a green finance ecosystem to support
Singapore’s and Asia’s transition towards a low-carbon future.&nbsp;Mr
Menon led MAS’ efforts to develop a taxonomy for transition financing,
forge an international coalition to promote transition credits, and build
a blended finance platform (Financing Asia’s Transition Partnership or
FAST-P) to address climate finance gaps and increase the bankability of
green and transition projects in Asia. Mr Menon has a strong international
network in climate finance.&nbsp;He has chaired international committees
such as the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial
System and the Asia-Pacific Advisory Board of the Glasgow Financial Alliance
for Net Zero.</p>
