<p><strong>Keynote Speech by Singapore’s Ambassador for Climate Action at Singapore Computer Society Sustainable Tech Forum</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Can the Geek and the Green Co-Exist?</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information, Dr Janil
Puthucheary, President of the Singapore Computer Society, Mr Sam Liew,
Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>POLITICS, ECONOMICS, AND NATURE</p>
<p>Let me start with the broader context: what is the future of climate action?&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The politics of climate change has become discernibly more challenging</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It’s not just the United States.&nbsp; There is political pushback against
the climate agenda in many countries.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The short-term frustrations over rising costs have trumped concerns over
the long-term perils of climate change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But the economics of climate change will drive the politics over the medium term</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The momentum for decarbonisation continues to gather pace, on the back
of cost considerations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solar and wind energy are now more cost-competitive than fossil fuels
in many parts of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The world now invests almost twice as much in clean energy as it does
in fossil fuels<sup>1</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many clean technologies that are still too expensive today are expected
to move down the cost curve over the medium term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Beyond politics and economics, nature will have the final say</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Climate change is already happening.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We are seeing more severe storms, wildfires, and floods, across the world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Climate change will get worse in the coming decades, as global temperatures
rise beyond the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Rising sea levels, heat waves, and water shortages will devastate lives
and livelihoods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually, countries and businesses will be forced to accelerate climate
action –</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>decarbonisation to mitigate climate change; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adaptation to deal with the consequences of climate change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The twin trends – decarbonisation and worsening climate change – will likely lead to a future that is both low-carbon and climate-impaired.</strong>
</p>
<p>SINGAPORE’S TRIPLE TRANSITION</p>
<p><strong>For Singapore, decarbonisation is both an international obligation and economic necessity.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Singapore contributes only 0.1% of global emissions but every country
must do its part.&nbsp; We have committed to reach net-zero emissions by
2050.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, the world will be reshaped by decarbonisation. Those
with the will and enterprise to successfully transition to net-zero will
thrive in this new world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Singapore needs to undertake a triple transition:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>an <strong><em>energy transition</em></strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a <strong><em>carbon transition</em></strong>; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an <strong><em>economic transition</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The triple transition will require us to fundamentally rethink the way we produce and consume</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The energy transition is about achieving a net-zero electricity grid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The carbon transition is about reducing to net-zero all primary carbon
emissions not related to electricity consumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The economic transition is about capturing new green growth opportunities
and restructuring the economy to remain competitive in a low-carbon future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TENSIONS BETWEEN THE GEEK AND THE GREEN</p>
<p><strong>The triple transition will entail numerous challenges - and the IT sector is one where the challenges can be particularly difficult</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The growing adoption of AI and the need for data centres has dramatically
increased energy consumption, and by extension carbon emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Globally, the ICT sector produces between 1.5% and 3% of carbon emissions<sup>2</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But left unchecked, the ICT sector could produce a third of global emissions
by 2050<sup>3</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there a fundamental conflict between AI development – and all the economic
and social opportunities it enables – and sustainability?</p>
<p>Can the geek and the green co-exist?&nbsp; The question is especially
relevant for Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>For the next stage of our growth, Singapore needs to be both a digital economy and a green economy</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We aspire to be a leading centre for AI applications – to unlock the next
frontier of economic growth and create positive impact for our people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also want to reach net-zero by 2050 and grow a competitive green economy
– a challenging task given our limited domestic recourse to renewable energy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no easy solutions.&nbsp; But those countries that successfully
resolve the tensions between the geek and the green stand to gain substantially.</p>
<p>There are two ways in which the geek and the green can not only co-exist
but can be mutually reinforcing:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>First, <strong><em>“greening the geek” – make the geek greener by decoupling the growth of AI from carbon emissions</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, <strong><em>“the geek enabling the green” – apply technology to support the broader greening of the economy</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>GREENING THE GEEK</p>
<p>Let me start with greening the geek.</p>
<p>This is essentially about <strong><em>reducing the ICT sector’s carbon emissions by raising energy efficiency – achieving the same outcomes using less energy.</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Singapore is focusing efforts on our largest source of ICT emissions – data centres.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We are a hub for data centres – critical facilities that consume a lot
of energy to store and process data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today, data centres contribute 82% of ICT-related emissions in Singapore<sup>4</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going forward, the explosive growth in generative AI will require a significant
increase in data centre capacity.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me outline four concrete steps Singapore is taking to green our data
centres:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>pausing the building of new data centres;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>raising the temperature at which data centres operate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>testing energy efficient cooling solutions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing more energy-efficient software.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>First, Singapore paused the building of new data centres for three years to re-evaluate how to build new capacity without compromising on our net-zero goals</strong><sup>5</sup>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The government will allocate future data centre capacity to operators
that prioritise both sustainability and economic value<sup>6</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this includes assessing their plans to use viable low-carbon energy sources
and best-in-class solutions to improve power usage effectiveness<sup>7</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second,</strong>  <strong>raising the temperature at which data centres can operate</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Data centres typically operate at 22 degrees Celsius.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has trialled running data
centres at 26 degrees Celsius and above with local operators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doing so can reduce energy used for cooling by up to 20% while maintaining
optimal results<sup>8</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third, testing novel energy efficient solutions to cool data centres</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Through the Sustainable Tropical Data Centre Testbed, researchers from
NUS and NTU are trialling new cooling solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, adapting Meta’s cooling system – which cools data centres
through water evaporation – to high humidity through coating heat exchangers
with special desiccants<sup>9</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fourth, developing more energy efficient software to achieve the same computing outcomes</strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Training a single large language deep learning model once produces 300
tonnes of carbon emissions. For a sense of scale, the average person consumes
the equivalent of 5 tonnes of carbon emissions a year<sup>10</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The AI community must move away from such “Red AI” approaches – simply
using ever more computing power to get incrementally better results.&nbsp;
This is neither sustainable nor smart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI developers must consider energy efficiency as a key parameter alongside
functionality, scalability, and security.&nbsp; This means things like:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>training pre-existing AI models on new data compared to training a new
model from scratch;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shifting towards reproducible, reusable code to avoid duplicated efforts;
and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing common standards for green software to drive their adoption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>IMDA is working with industry partners to set objective criteria for what
counts as green software. It is important that all ICT firms align with
these standards.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>THE GEEK ENABLING THE GREEN</p>
<p>The geek becoming green is important.&nbsp; But the synergy between the
two becomes much stronger when the geek can enable the green – where the
ICT sector can support the broader greening of the economy<strong><em>.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Let me outline five ways in which ICT can enable effective climate action:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>advance climate science research;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>optimise resource and energy use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide solutions for decarbonisation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enable measurement, reporting and verification of carbon footprint; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote green procurement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>First, ICT can contribute upstream by advancing climate science research.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To take more informed actions on climate change, we need to know what
is happening to planetary ecosystems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology, AI in particular, can be a powerful tool for climate research.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For example, AI can measure changes in icebergs 10,000 times faster than
a human.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can create detailed maps of ocean litter in remote locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can map millions of hectares of forest to measure forest density and
deforestation rates<sup>11</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second, ICT can help businesses optimise their workflows, and reduce wastage of resources.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In manufacturing, Evercomm, a company founded by two NTU alumni, is driving
process improvements on the factory floor<sup>12</sup>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Evercomm’s network of sensors are attached to factory equipment to generate
data on resource use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Machine learning algorithms then suggest optimal equipment settings and
production schedules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MNCs such as General Electric and GlobalFoundries have used these insights
to fine-tune their operations and reduce energy usage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In land transport, Clickargo is optimising the usage of commercial vehicles.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>By providing a platform to track vehicle movement and optimise vehicle
routes, Clickargo helps companies reduce emissions by shortening delivery
routes, weeding out vehicle idling, and closing the delivery loop faster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third, ICT can provide novel solutions for decarbonisation.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Take for example the direct air capture of carbon dioxide – a nascent
technology which is currently expensive but will be necessary if the world
is to reach net-zero.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Using AI, researchers from the University of Surrey demonstrated a 16%
increase in carbon capture from a coal-fired power station.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI algorithms increased the flow rate of water containing limestone to
trap carbon in reaction to spikes in emission levels from the coal plant<sup>13</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another example - novel carbon-absorbent materials.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Scientists are using generative AI to design new materials without relying
on time-consuming experimental work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A supercomputer then calculates key properties such as stability and capacity
for carbon capture. Billions of such candidates can be surveyed at once<sup>14</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aim is to find a material that is very effective at carbon capture
at low cost.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fourth, ICT solutions can help companies map their carbon footprint and meet sustainability reporting requirements.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Singapore has introduced mandatory climate reporting.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>While the reporting is directed at large companies, SMEs in the supply
chains of these companies will then come under pressure to report their
carbon footprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will need to find a way to lower the compliance costs on companies,
especially SMEs, in meeting these reporting requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ESGPedia, a Singapore-based digital platform, is trying to do just that.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It collects operational data from companies, calculates carbon emissions,
and submits the data for independent verification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Companies can generate performance reports to demonstrate progress towards
green targets, and use them to access financing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, textile manufacturer Ghim Li partnered with ESGPedia to successfully
obtain a S$16 million sustainability-linked loan from OCBC to finance investments
to reduce carbon emissions intensity in its garment factories<sup>15</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fifth, the ICT sector can promote green procurement to nudge companies across the supply chain towards more sustainable practices.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The government is leaning in with its procurement budget.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It now requires ICT equipment that it purchases to meet the ENERGY STAR
standard – a globally recognised standard for energy efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Up to 5% of the evaluation points for ICT tenders worth S$10 million and
above is allocated to sustainability considerations.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The government is looking into other areas such as assessing the quality
of sustainability reporting by ICT companies, and the power usage effectiveness
of data centres used by cloud providers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ICT companies can also incentivise suppliers to transition faster through green procurement contracts.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Globally, the Big Tech companies have been taking the lead.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Apple has committed to becoming carbon-neutral across all its supply chains
by 2030<sup>16</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google is asking its largest hardware suppliers to commit to using 100%
renewable energy by 2029<sup>17</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locally, the SingTel Group incorporates a carbon fee of $50 per tonne
of carbon emissions in its tender process for projects surpassing 1,000
tonnes<sup>18</sup>, and requires its largest suppliers to disclose their
environmental impact and carbon reduction plans.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There is scope to do much more green procurement in Singapore.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Progress has been slow due to two factors:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>one, green procurement will come at a higher cost;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two, concerns of being accused of “greenwashing” if such procurement is
done poorly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These concerns are not trivial but can be mitigated.&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Green procurement may indeed be more costly in the short-term, but it
is an investment in medium-term competitiveness, as sustainability reporting
kicks in and companies’ emissions level come under greater scrutiny.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And by building capabilities, greenwashing risks can be reduced over time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We can promote green procurement through coalitions of like-minded companies.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>One, companies can collaborate and jointly demand for green products and
services.&nbsp; Aggregated demand can stimulate supply at scale and lower
unit costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two, companies can build a base of practical knowledge on green procurement.
&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The National Sustainable Procurement Roundtable (NSPR) is a good example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has published a suppliers’ guide which lays out how companies can design,
implement, and track progress in green procurement, including guidance
on avoiding common greenwashing risks. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me conclude.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should not have to choose between technology and sustainability.&nbsp;
The geek and the green <em>can</em> co-exist; in fact, they <em>must</em>.&nbsp;
But it will not be easy.&nbsp; It will require determined effort, creative
collaboration, and a hard-headed approach.&nbsp; We need both the optimism
of the geek and the realism of the green.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish you a fruitful day – knocking heads together on how to green the
geek and how the geek can enable the green.</p>
