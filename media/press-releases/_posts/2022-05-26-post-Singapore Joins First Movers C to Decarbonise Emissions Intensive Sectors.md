**JOINT PRESS RELEASE BY NCCS, MTI AND MOT: SINGAPORE JOINS FIRST MOVERS COALITION TO DECARBONISE EMISSIONS-INTENSIVE SECTORS**

Singapore has joined the First Movers Coalition (FMC) as a Government Partner, along with Denmark, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. First announced by U.S. President Joe Biden at the COP-26 World Leaders Summit in November 2021, the FMC serves as a platform for companies to harness their purchasing power and supply chains to create early markets for innovative clean energy technologies to tackle the climate crisis.

Singapore’s membership to the FMC builds on our commitment to achieve net zero emissions by or around mid-century, in line with the Glasgow Climate Pact. Our participation in the FMC is aligned with our efforts to decarbonise the economy, including emissions-intensive sectors, and promoting public-private collaboration to develop and scale low-carbon technologies.

Such efforts include working with private sector partners to establish the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation to pilot and deploy low-carbon technologies and fuels in the maritime sector.  Singapore is also bringing together public research institutes and Energy & Chemicals companies for a Carbon Capture and Utilisation Translational Testbed, to facilitate the evaluation of such technologies. 

The Government will engage companies and encourage them to participate in the FMC. The FMC presents an opportunity for companies to collaborate with like-minded partners and access low-carbon technologies. 

Minister for Transport and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations S Iswaran announced Singapore’s membership to the FMC at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting at Davos on 25 May 2022. He said, “Climate change is an existential threat, especially to a small island state like Singapore. As a global business and financial hub, Singapore is well-placed to contribute to the FMC in developing and scaling up innovative low-carbon technologies in hard-to-abate sectors. We look forward to working closely with the FMC government partners and industry players to enable a low-carbon future.”

Singapore seeks to work with international and regional partners to enable collaborations, strengthen consensus and galvanise collective climate action.
