<p><strong>SINGAPORE AND RWANDA INVITE APPLICATIONS FOR CARBON CREDIT PROJECTS UNDER BILATERAL IMPLEMENTATION AGREEMENT</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong></strong> Singapore and Rwanda have
launched an application call for carbon credit projects under their Implementation
Agreement on carbon credits cooperation. This is Singapore’s fourth call
for project applications, following earlier calls under bilateral Implementation
Agreements with Ghana, Peru and Bhutan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Authorised projects will unlock additional carbon mitigation projects in
Rwanda and advance both countries’ climate ambitions through targeted financing.
These projects will promote sustainable development and benefit local communities
through job creation, clean water access, improved energy security, and
reduced environmental pollution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Authorised projects can generate carbon credits aligned with Article 6
of the Paris Agreement. Under Singapore’s International Carbon Credit (ICC)
Framework, these credits will be eligible for use by Singapore-based carbon
tax-liable companies to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Interested parties may submit applications for their carbon credit projects
in Rwanda to be authorised. Applications submitted will be reviewed by
the Singapore and Rwanda governments.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Application and Authorisation Process</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p> The application and authorisation
process comprises three stages, each corresponding to a different stage
of implementation for the carbon credit project (See <strong><u>Annex A)</u></strong>.
The first two stages require applicants to submit details on the design
and implementation plan for the carbon credit project in the lead-up to
project authorisation. The final stage is for corresponding adjustments
to be applied to the carbon credits generated from the authorised project,
in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement. Detailed
steps on the application process can be found at Singapore’s Carbon Markets
Cooperation website, at <a href="http://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/overview-rwanda/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/overview-rwanda/</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Singapore and Rwanda will
assess applications in accordance with each country’s respective requirements.
For Singapore, these projects must meet Singapore’s eligibility criteria
for ICCs. The eligibility criteria, and the list of eligible carbon crediting
programmes and methodologies under the Singapore-Rwanda Implementation
Agreement, are at <strong><u>Annex B</u></strong>, and on the Carbon Markets
Cooperation website.</p>
