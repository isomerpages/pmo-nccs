<p><strong>LAUNCH OF GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-INTEGRITY CARBON MARKETS</strong>
</p>
<p>The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS), Ministry of Trade and
Industry (MTI), Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) and Monetary Authority
of Singapore (MAS) are advancing initiatives to support the development
of high-integrity carbon markets. These include (a) the publication of
voluntary carbon market (VCM) guidance on how companies can use carbon
credits as part of their decarbonisation plans; (b) ongoing discussions
with leading corporates in Asia to set up an industry-led buyers’ coalition
to aggregate demand for high-quality carbon credits; and (c) the introduction
of a new Financial Sector Carbon Market Development Grant to support financial
institutions’ participation in carbon markets.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Carbon markets are a critical enabler for the global transition to net
zero, channelling capital towards climate action. However, the growth of
carbon markets has been constrained in recent years by weak demand, limited
supply of high-integrity projects, and underdeveloped market infrastructure.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To address these gaps, the Singapore Government has introduced a suite
of initiatives to catalyse demand for high-quality carbon credits, grow
the pipeline of credible projects, and strengthen market infrastructure
and capabilities across the carbon market value chain. These initiatives
include the launch of the Carbon Project Development Grant at COP29, and
active collaboration with international partners through Singapore’s Article
6 partnerships and the Coalition to Grow Carbon Markets announced at London
Climate Action Week earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>Voluntary Carbon Market Guidance and Buyers’ Coalition</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NCCS, MTI and EnterpriseSG jointly published the VCM guidance today to
guide companies in using carbon credits as part of a credible decarbonisation
plan. The VCM guidance was developed in close consultation with &nbsp;&nbsp;the
Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA), industry partners, academics,
and international organisations, and is available at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/vcmguidance2025" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/vcmguidance2025</a>.
It will be regularly reviewed and updated to keep pace with the latest
developments.<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a>
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To demonstrate application of the key principles outlined within the VCM
guidance, EnterpriseSG is in discussions with leading corporates in Asia
to establish an industry-led buyers’ coalition to align and channel demand
towards high-integrity carbon credits in the region and beyond. More details
will be shared in 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Sector Carbon Market Development Grant</strong>
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Financial institutions play a key enabling role in the carbon market value
chain — from structuring transactions and financing projects, to underwriting
risk mitigation solutions, and trading credits. Apart from concerns over
market integrity and demand, financial institutions may also face high
upfront costs in developing needed expertise, and managing the complexity
and risks of early transactions.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To address these challenges, MAS will introduce a Financial Sector Carbon
Market Development Grant (details in <u>Annex C</u>), to help alleviate
near-term cost barriers faced by financial institutions and build the foundation
for their sustained involvement in carbon markets.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MAS will set aside S$15 million over three years till 2028, from the Financial
Sector Development Fund to support:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Building carbon market capabilities: </strong>Supporting the establishment
or expansion of financial institutions teams engaged in carbon-project
financing, trading, insurance and related services; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Catalysing innovative financing solutions and platforms:</strong> Defraying
upfront costs associated with transaction structuring, financing, risk
management, and trading of carbon credits - including for due diligence,
verification and carbon credit insurance premiums.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications
for the grant will open on 1 November 2025. Further information on eligibility
requirements and the application process is available on the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/financial-sector-carbon-market" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MAS website</a>.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Together, these initiatives aim to help catalyse the development of high-integrity
carbon markets, to deliver tangible and credible impact for global climate
action.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr Ravi Menon, Ambassador for Climate Action and Senior Adviser, NCCS,
said “Carbon markets play an important role in mobilising finance for climate
action and supporting the global transition to net zero. At the same time,
they support sustainable development and growth in countries where the
carbon projects are situated. Through the VCM guidance, we seek to provide
our businesses with greater clarity and assurance to tap on high-quality
credits, alongside their own efforts to decarbonise. We hope that this
can encourage greater corporate climate ambition, contributing to global
climate action.”</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr Lee Pak Sing, Assistant Managing Director for Trade and Connectivity
at Enterprise Singapore, said “This VCM guidance provides companies with
clarity to incorporate the use of carbon credits in their decarbonisation
plans. By outlining how to identify high-quality carbon credits, when to
use them and how to transparently disclose their use, companies can develop
credible decarbonisation strategies and contribute to global climate action.”</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ms Abigail Ng, Chief Sustainability Officer of MAS, said “High-integrity
carbon markets are integral to financing the global transition, and financial
institutions play a key role in bringing capital, innovation and scale
to this space. The new Financial Sector Carbon Market Development Grant
will enable financial institutions to deepen expertise, forge partnerships
and develop solutions, laying the foundations for their sustained engagement
in the carbon markets.”</p>
