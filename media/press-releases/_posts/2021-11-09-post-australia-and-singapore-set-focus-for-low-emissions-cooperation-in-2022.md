JOINT COMMUNIQUE BY SINGAPORE AND AUSTRALIA

Australia is working with Singapore to find solutions to global climate change challenges through the Singapore-Australia Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for Cooperation on Low-Emissions Solutions.

The first annual dialogue under the MoU took place on 15 October 2021. The dialogue outlined the progress so far and the plan ahead for the MoU priority areas  in 2022 which includes: 

•	Conducting joint studies on low-emission solutions (e.g. a hydrogen supply chain study)

•	Collaborative research and development on low-emission solutions (including hosting a joint research symposium)

•	Explore large-scale renewable electricity trade 

•	Regional emissions measurement, verification and reporting capacity building efforts.

Singapore and Australia also announced a low emissions technology partnership in June 2021 to build on the MoU. The partnership supports the commercialisation of low-emissions fuels and technologies in maritime shipping and port operations.   

Both countries remain committed to their strong partnership in developing a low-carbon and sustainable future.
