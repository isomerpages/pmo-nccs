<h4><strong>International Coalition Launches Collective Government-Backed Framework For Corporate Use Of High-Integrity Carbon Credits</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Governments of France, Kenya, Singapore, the UK, and Panama collectively
announce principles for business on the use of high-integrity carbon credits
to unlock capital for development, support economic activity, and enable
progress towards global climate goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan of Action will accelerate the development of policies and incentives
to aggregate carbon credit demand and drive private sector investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coalition urges additional governments to join efforts and create a broader
basis for collective action.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>São Paulo, Brazil | 4 November 2025</strong> – The Coalition to
Grow Carbon Markets (“the Coalition”) launched today a set of shared principles
providing consistency across countries to boost corporate demand for high-integrity
carbon credits as a complement to direct emissions reductions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Backed by multiple governments, the Shared Principles for Growing High-Integrity
Use of Carbon Credits by Companies and Other Buyers (“Shared Principles”)
were issued at the COP30 Business and Finance Forum, alongside a Plan of
Action. Together these set out the Coalition’s forward-looking agenda to
promote the development of carbon markets through supportive policies and
incentives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Coalition was launched at London Climate Action Week 2025 and is co-chaired
by the Governments of Kenya, Singapore and the United Kingdom, alongside
founding members, France and Panama.</p>
<p>With this announcement, the Coalition aims to drive climate-positive growth
and accelerate the pace of emissions reductions worldwide by strengthening
the incentives businesses need to invest in high-integrity carbon credits
across carbon markets, including voluntary and Article 6 markets.</p>
<p>Developed with inputs from governments from around the world and informed
by business leaders and market experts, the Shared Principles will provide
companies with the clarity and confidence they need to purchase carbon
credits as part of credible decarbonisation plans.</p>
<p>The Coalition’s work on the Shared Principles was driven by feedback from
businesses that governments should provide consistent guidance across markets
and the right policies to incentivise them to engage in high-integrity
carbon credit markets to help them manage climate risk and enhance their
decarbonisation efforts.</p>
<p>Today's announcement has been welcomed by the Coalition's partners, including
World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and International Emissions Trading Association
(IETA), which have worked closely with the Coalition to inform and shape
the outputs. It has also been welcomed by the Integrity Council for the
Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) which is working with the Coalition to
support seamless alignment between the demand and supply sides of the market.
A Business Advisory Group convened by WBCSD, made up of senior representatives
from across sectors, will provide ongoing corporate input into the Coalition
activities.</p>
<p>The Shared Principles have also been supported by a range of climate,
sustainable development and finance organisations including the Environmental
Defense Fund, The Nature Conservancy, African Union Development Agency,
Green Finance Institute, Malaysian Carbon Markets Association, Singapore
Sustainable Finance Association, National Indian Carbon Coalition, Verra
and Isometric.</p>
<p><strong>An Internationally Aligned Framework for Corporate Use of Carbon Credits</strong>
</p>
<p>The Shared Principles establish six pillars for corporate use of carbon
credits:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Using carbon credits in addition to decarbonisation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring rigorous quality standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upholding fair value and social benefits;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintaining transparent reporting;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making accurate, substantiated claims; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actively supporting market development.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These pillars achieve international alignment on critical questions about
the role of carbon credits and will inform national policies and incentives
to unlock private sector investment in climate solutions through carbon
markets.</p>
<p>In endorsing the Shared Principles, each government commits to explore,
develop and continue pursuing supportive policies or regulations aligned
with the framework. This could include stronger government recognition
for companies that follow the Shared Principles.</p>
<p><strong>A Plan of Action to Strengthen Carbon Markets</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure these Principles are translated into higher levels of investment,
the Coalition also published its Plan of Action, which will guide the Coalition’s
work through to COP33 and map a clear path to impact.</p>
<p>Built on the premise that clear, consistent, and stable government signals
and incentives drive corporate demand, this Plan of Action details the
ambitious steps the Coalition will take while respecting the national circumstances
of its members. It includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Policy implementation:</strong> Expand Coalition membership, support
governments in adopting Shared Principles-aligned policies and incentives,
and foster ongoing dialogue among governments, businesses, and international
standard-setters to reduce fragmentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capital mobilisation with equitable pricing &amp; access: </strong>Engage
buyers’ networks to aggregate and scale demand, and collaborate with academic
partners and existing initiatives to demonstrate the positive impact of
responsible carbon credit demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Market development:</strong> Develop internationally consistent
guidance in collaboration with existing initiatives, and support interoperable,
transparent infrastructure through engagement with global efforts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Building International Momentum Ahead of COP30 Negotiations</strong>
</p>
<p>The Coalition addresses an urgent need. The world will miss its climate
targets unless much more finance flows to projects and businesses that
can cut emissions quickly and affordably, while promoting growth and development.
Carbon markets are an important tool to price carbon, enable more ambitious
climate action, and drive private sector investment into the global low-carbon
transformation.</p>
<p>The Coalition’s work complements the COP30 Presidency’s objective to mobilise
carbon markets, and other initiatives designed to unlock the potential
of compliance and Article 6 markets.</p>
<p>Together these initiatives will help realise the transformational potential
of carbon markets - unlocking greater flows of climate finance, deeper
decarbonisation for the private sector, and new economic opportunities.</p>
