<p><strong>Singapore Signs Implementation Agreement with Ghana to Collaborate on Carbon Credits Under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore and Ghana signed an Implementation Agreement on carbon credits
cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement on 27 May 2024. The
Agreement was signed virtually between Singapore’s Minister for Sustainability
and the Environment and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations Grace Fu,
and Ghana’s Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation
Ophelia Hayford.</p>
<p>After the signing, both countries will commence with the ratification
process and operationalise the Agreement. This sets out a legally binding
framework and processes for the generation and international transfer of
carbon credits between Singapore and Ghana, aligned with Article 6 of the
Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>This collaboration will advance both countries’ climate ambition and channel
financing towards additional mitigation efforts. The carbon credit projects
authorised under the Implementation Agreement will seek to promote sustainable
development and generate benefits for local communities, such as creation
of jobs, access to clean water, improved energy security, and reduction
of environmental pollution.</p>
<p>Under the Implementation Agreement, project developers will be required
to make a contribution equivalent to 5% share of proceeds from authorised
carbon credits towards climate adaptation in Ghana, which helps Ghana prepare
for and adjust to the impacts of climate change. They will also be required
to cancel 2% of authorised carbon credits at first issuance to ensure additional
contribution to overall mitigation of global emissions.</p>
<p>Under Singapore’s International Carbon Credit (ICC) framework, eligible
ICCs generated under this Implementation Agreement may be used by Singapore-based
carbon tax-liable companies to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions.</p>
<p>Minister Fu said, “Singapore and Ghana share many mutual interests in
the sustainability sphere. The conclusion of the Implementation Agreement
is testament to our shared commitment to advance global climate action
through high-integrity carbon markets. The carbon credit projects that
are implemented under this Agreement will generate climate benefits as
well as benefits to our economies. Singapore will continue our efforts
to work with like-minded partners like Ghana to co-create opportunities
for a sustainable future.”</p>
<p>This is the second Implementation Agreement for Singapore, after the first
with Papua New Guinea which was signed in December 2023.</p>
