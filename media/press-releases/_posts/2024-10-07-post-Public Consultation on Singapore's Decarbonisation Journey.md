<p>The National Climate Change Secretariat in the Strategy Group, Prime Minister’s
Office has launched a public consultation on Singapore’s decarbonisation
journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We welcome views from all interested parties on Singapore’s decarbonisation
journey, including Singapore’s ambition to achieve net zero emissions by
2050, our transition towards a low-carbon economy, and the decarbonisation
measures we will undertake. These views will be taken into consideration
as Singapore develops our next bound of climate targets, measures and policies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Singapore is an early and committed contributor to global climate action.
In 2020, Singapore submitted our enhanced 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution
(NDC) and Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS). We had previously
held a public consultation in 2022. Subsequently, we raised our ambition
to reduce emissions to around 60 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2030, after peaking
emissions earlier, and to achieve net zero by 2050. Singapore will be submitting
our next NDC in early-2025.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For Singapore to achieve our climate targets, we need to progress concurrently
on three transitions:</p>
<p>(a) A carbon transition to reduce emissions across all sectors;</p>
<p>(b) An energy transition to achieve a resilient net zero electricity grid;
and</p>
<p>(c) An economic transition to remain competitive in a low-carbon future
and to capture new green growth opportunities.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These transitions will bring both opportunities as well as trade-offs.
The shift towards a lower carbon economy presents significant growth potential
in green economic activities across diverse sectors, including manufacturing,
trade, professional services and finance. This same shift will inevitably
lead to disruptions to existing business models or entire industries. Companies
will need to rethink their value chains and pursue new areas of growth
that are less carbon intensive, while workers will have to acquire new
skills to stay relevant.</p>
<p>
<br>Our decarbonisation journey is a whole-of-nation effort and will require
everyone to play a part. As individuals, we may need to change our personal
habits, by consuming and wasting less, reducing energy consumption at home
such as using energy efficient appliances and less air-conditioning, and
taking cleaner forms of transport such as embracing a walk, cycle and ride
lifestyle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The consultation exercise will end on 5 November 2024, 11:59pm. We welcome
interested parties to submit their feedback through this link: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/feedbacksgdecarb" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>https://go.gov.sg/feedbacksgdecarb</u></a>.</p>
