<p><strong>Media Release on MOU between Singapore and Indonesia on Community Empowerment in Mangrove Ecosystems </strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore’s Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security
Teo Chee Hean and Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs
and Investment Luhut Pandjaitan signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
at the Singapore-Indonesia Leaders’ Retreat in Bogor, Indonesia, to collaborate
on community empowerment activities relating to mangrove ecosystems in
Indonesia.</p>
<p>Under the MOU, both governments will set up a bilateral framework to facilitate
the participation of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and stakeholders
to promote the sustainable use of mangrove resources in local communities,
starting with a pilot in Setokok Island in Batam, Indonesia. Key activities
to be carried out under the MOU include promoting community awareness on
the importance of developing sustainable mangrove ecosystems and sharing
of best practices on sustainable use of mangrove products and economic
opportunities from mangrove ecotourism, which can improve local community
livelihoods.</p>
<p>Both governments will also mobilise academic and research institutions
in Indonesia and Singapore, local and international NGOs and stakeholders
to undertake activities relating to the conservation and rehabilitation
of mangroves and to conduct research on best practices in mangrove restoration
and exploratory approaches for quantifying carbon contributions in mangrove
ecosystems.</p>
<p>“The signing of this MOU underscores the close ties between Singapore
and Indonesia in the government and people sectors, and our shared commitment
towards advancing climate action and environmental sustainability. We look
forward to more of such collaborations, which can also serve as pathfinder
projects for the region” says Mr Teo Chee Hean, Senior Minister and Chairman
of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change.</p>
<p>On 21 March 2022, both countries signed a MOU on Climate Change and Sustainability.</p>
