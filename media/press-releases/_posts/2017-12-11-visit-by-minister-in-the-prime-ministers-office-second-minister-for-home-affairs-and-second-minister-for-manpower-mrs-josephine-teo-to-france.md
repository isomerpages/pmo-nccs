Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, Second Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Manpower, Mrs Josephine Teo will visit France from 11 to 13 December 2017 to attend the One Planet Summit (OPS) as Special Envoy of the Prime Minister to the OPS. 

Taking place on 12 December 2017, the OPS will be co-chaired by French President Emmanuel Macron, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim.  The OPS will commemorate the second anniversary of the adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.  It will bring together key actors to focus on financing climate actions and aligning financial flows in order to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. 

Minister Teo’s attendance at the OPS reaffirms Singapore’s commitment to the full and universal implementation of the Paris Agreement.  Singapore has pledged to reduce its emissions intensity by 36 per cnet from 2005 levels by 2030 and to stabilise emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030.  Minister Teo will also highlight Singapore’s policies to promote innovative climate financing as well as the role of our business community to transition towards a greener, low-carbon economy.

Minister Teo will be accompanied by officials from the National Climate Change Secretariat (Strategy Group, Prime Minister’s Office) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
