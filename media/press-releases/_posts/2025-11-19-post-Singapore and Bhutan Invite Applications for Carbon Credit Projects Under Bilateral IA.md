<p><strong>SINGAPORE AND BHUTAN INVITE APPLICATIONS FOR CARBON CREDIT PROJECTS UNDER BILATERAL IMPLEMENTATION AGREEMENT</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore and Bhutan have launched an application call for carbon credit
projects under their Implementation Agreement on carbon credits cooperation.
&nbsp;This is Singapore’s third call for project applications after similar
agreements with Ghana and Peru.</p>
<p>Authorised projects will unlock additional carbon mitigation in Bhutan
and advance both countries’ climate ambitions through targeted financing.
These projects will promote sustainable development and benefit local communities
through job creation, clean water access, improved energy security, and
reduced environmental pollution</p>
<p>Authorised projects can generate carbon credits aligned with Article 6
of the Paris Agreement. Under Singapore’s International Carbon Credit (ICC)
Framework, these credits will be eligible for use by Singapore-based carbon
tax-liable companies to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions.</p>
<p>From 1 December 2025, interested parties may submit applications for their
carbon credit projects in Bhutan to be authorised. Applications submitted
will be reviewed by the Singapore and Bhutan governments.</p>
<p><strong>Application and Authorisation Process</strong>
</p>
<p>The application and authorisation process comprises three stages, each
corresponding to a different stage of implementation for the carbon credit
project (See <strong><u>Annex A</u></strong>). The first two stages require
applicants to submit details on the design and implementation plan for
the carbon credit project in the lead-up to project authorisation. The
final stage is for corresponding adjustments to be applied to the carbon
credits generated from the authorised project, in accordance with Article
6, Paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement. Detailed steps on the application
process can be found at Singapore’s Carbon Markets Cooperation website,
at <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg</a>.</p>
<p>Singapore and Bhutan will assess applications against each country’s respective
requirements. For Singapore, these projects must meet Singapore’s eligibility
criteria for ICCs. The eligibility criteria, and the list of eligible carbon
crediting programmes and methodologies under the Singapore-Bhutan Implementation
Agreement, are at <strong><u>Annex B</u></strong>, and on the Carbon Markets
Cooperation website.</p>
