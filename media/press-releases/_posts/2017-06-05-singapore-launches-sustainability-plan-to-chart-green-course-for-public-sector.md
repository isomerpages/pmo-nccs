The public sector has unveiled an action plan to conserve resources and embark on green initiatives, and hopes it will inspire all Singaporeans to work towards greater environmental sustainability. The inaugural Public Sector Sustainability Plan 2017-2020 (PSSP) was launched by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister in Charge of the Public Service, Teo Chee Hean, at the opening ceremony of the Singapore Sustainability Academy 1 on World Environment Day.

The public sector is Singapore’s largest employer, comprising 16 ministries, 64 statutory boards and about 145,000 public officers. As a significant consumer of natural resources, the public sector is taking the lead to contribute to the nationwide Sustainable Singapore Movement, and the goals articulated in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint.

The PSSP outlines the public sector’s collective efforts to go green. This includes embarking on innovative initiatives and projects, such as government-wide green procurement of electronics and paper products, food waste recycling in public sector premises and a floating solar test-bed in Tengeh Reservoir.

To foster greater accountability and increase the transparency and disclosure of its environmental performance, the public sector has also set targets to reduce electricity and water consumption by 15% and 5% respectively by 2020. The public sector is currently on track to achieve these two targets. To achieve greener buildings, the public sector is aiming for all large public sector buildings to achieve at least BCA Green Mark Gold rating by 2020. To date, all new public sector buildings are on track to attain the highest Green Mark Platinum standard, and existing buildings are aiming to attain at least the Green Mark Gold standard. To reduce waste and support clean energy, targets will also be set for waste reduction and solar adoption in future.

With the launch of the PSSP and through sharing our efforts in environmental sustainability, the public sector strongly encourages the people and private sectors to adopt more green practices and make sustainability a way of life. Everyone has a part to play in building a Sustainable Singapore.
