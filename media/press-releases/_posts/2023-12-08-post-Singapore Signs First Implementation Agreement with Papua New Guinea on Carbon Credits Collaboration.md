<p><strong>Singapore Signs First Implementation Agreement with Papua New Guinea to Collaborate on Carbon Credits Under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore and Papua New Guinea (PNG) signed an Implementation Agreement
on carbon credits cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement today.
The Agreement was signed by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment
Grace Fu and Papua New Guinea Minister of Environment, Conservation and
Climate Change Simo Kilepa on the sidelines of the 2023 United Nations
Climate Change Conference (COP28). The Agreement comes after both countries
signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the sidelines of COP27 last
year to collaborate on carbon credits.</p>
<p>This marks the first Implementation Agreement for Singapore. The Agreement
sets out a legally binding framework and processes for the generation and
international transfer of carbon credits aligned with Article 6 of the
Paris Agreement, between Singapore and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>This collaboration will advance both countries’ climate ambition and help
to channel financing towards additional mitigation efforts through carbon
credit projects which would otherwise not be possible. The carbon credit
projects authorised under the Implementation Agreement will also promote
sustainable development and generate benefits for local communities, such
as creation of jobs, access to clean water, improved energy security, and
reduction of environmental pollution.</p>
<p>As part of Singapore’s Article 6 cooperation, project developers will
be required to cancel 2% of the carbon credits authorised under the Implementation
Agreement at first issuance to ensure additional contribution to overall
mitigation of global emissions. They will also be required to make a contribution
equivalent to 5% share of proceeds or authorised carbon credits towards
climate adaptation in Papua New Guinea. This will help Papua New Guinea
prepare for and adjust to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Singapore is also supporting the development of carbon markets, by enabling
the demand and supply of high-quality carbon credits to be matched. Under
Singapore’s International Carbon Credit (ICC) framework, Singapore-based
carbon tax-liable companies can source for eligible ICCs generated under
this Implementation Agreement to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions.
Trading these credits through Singapore will help to unlock new business
opportunities in areas such as carbon services and sustainability solutions,
strengthening Singapore’s position as a carbon services and trading hub.</p>
<p>Minister Fu said, “High-integrity carbon markets can contribute to much-needed
climate action globally. As an alternative energy disadvantaged country,
effective international cooperation, such as through carbon markets, will
also help us to achieve our climate ambitions. We are delighted to sign
our first Implementation Agreement with Papua New Guinea, a fellow Alliance
of Small Island States (AOSIS) member. We look forward to working with
Papua New Guinea to advance climate action together.”</p>
