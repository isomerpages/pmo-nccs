<p>Singapore and Ghana have set out the processes for authorising carbon
credit projects under their Implementation Agreement on carbon credits
cooperation, in accordance with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Applications
may be submitted through Singapore’s Carbon Markets Cooperation website,
at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The carbon credit projects authorised under the Implementation Agreement
will channel financing towards emissions reduction or removal projects
in Ghana. These projects can promote sustainable development and generate
benefits for local communities, including job creation, clean water access,
improvements to energy security, and reducing environmental pollution (See<strong> <u>Annex A</u></strong> for
potential project types).</p>
<p></p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Authorised projects can generate carbon credits aligned with Article 6
of the Paris Agreement. Under Singapore’s International Carbon Credit (ICC)
Framework, these credits may be eligible for use by Singapore-based carbon
tax-liable companies to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From 30 September 2024, interested parties may submit applications for
their carbon credit projects in Ghana to be authorised. Applications submitted
will be reviewed by Singapore and Ghana governments on a rolling basis
as they are received.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Application and Authorisation Process</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The application and authorisation process comprises four stages, each corresponding
to a different stage of implementation for the carbon credit project (See <strong><u>Annex B)</u></strong>.
The first three stages require applicants to submit details on the design
and implementation plan for the carbon credit project in the lead-up to
project authorisation. The final stage is for corresponding adjustments
to be applied to the carbon credits generated from the authorised project,
in accordance with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Singapore and Ghana will assess applications against each country’s respective
requirements. For Singapore, these projects must meet Singapore’s Eligibility
Criteria for International Carbon Credits. The Eligibility Criteria, and
the list of eligible carbon crediting programmes and methodologies under
the Singapore-Ghana Implementation Agreement, are at <strong><u>Annex C,</u> </strong>and
on the Carbon Markets Cooperation website. The list will be reviewed regularly
to maintain relevance and uphold environmental integrity.</p>

<p>Clean Water Supply</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Rural communities are provided with water purification technologies (e.g.
UV-based disinfection systems). This empowers communities with an alternate
source of clean and safe drinking water without relying on the conventional
method of using firewood to boil water. This reduces carbon emissions from
burning firewood and associated deforestation activities, and carbon credits
are issued based on the emissions reduced.</p>
<p>Local communities can also benefit from improved water safety and security.</p>
</td>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Efficient and Clean Cookstoves</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>In rural areas where households use firewood for their cooking and heating
needs, the switch to efficient and clean cookstoves (e.g. cookstoves that
use renewable fuel like biogas or solar energy) enables households to meet
their cooking and heating needs more efficiently and cleanly. This reduces
the burning of firewood and resulting carbon emissions from deforestation.
Carbon credits are issued based on the emissions reduced.</p>
<p>Co-benefits are also delivered to local communities, including cleaner
air quality through the reduction of firewood burning.</p>
</td>

<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Green Mobility</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>As Electric Vehicles (EVs) replace fossil fuel-powered vehicles for transportation
needs, there are emissions reductions as EVs are more efficient and potentially
powered by green energy. Carbon credits are issued based on the emissions
reduced.</p>
<p>There are also sustainable development benefits for local communities.
Skilled jobs are created for the maintenance of EV infrastructure, and
improves air quality from reduced reliance on fossil fuel-powered vehicles.</p>
