The National Climate Change Secretariat in the Strategy Group, Prime Minister’s Office has launched a public consultation on Singapore’s raised climate ambition from 5 to 26 September 2022 on the [REACH website](http://go.gov.sg/reach-pc-climate-2022).

Through this public consultation, we welcome views from all interested parties on how Singapore can work towards becoming a low-carbon country as we consider raising our long-term ambition to achieve net zero by 2050 and whether to raise our 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to support this ambition. This complements other ongoing engagements under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, involving in particular businesses, environmental groups, students and youths. Feedback received will be taken into consideration when Singapore makes a formal revision to our Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) and 2030 NDC before the end of 2022.

At Budget 2022, Singapore first announced that it will raise its climate ambition to achieve net zero by or around mid-century, in line with the Glasgow Climate Pact. This is a significant improvement on our LEDS, which was submitted in 2020, to halve emissions from our 2030 peak to 33 MtCO2e by 2050, with a view to achieving net zero emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century. Singapore also committed to reviewing our 2030 NDC which currently pledges to peak emissions at 65 MtCO2e around 2030. Building on Singapore’s long-standing emphasis on sustainable development, making a decisive move to net zero will ensure that we do our part in the global fight against climate change.

As an international business and financial hub, Singapore is well-positioned to take advantage of the positive global trends in sustainable financing and corporate net zero targets and develop as an attractive place for green economic activities in industry, services, and finance. In re-positioning our economy and establishing our competitive edge early, this will allow us to capture many good jobs for Singaporeans and enhance Singapore’s value proposition in the future low-carbon global economy. This transition to a low-carbon future will require the efforts from everyone – companies will have to be less carbon intensive in their operations, workers have to acquire new skills and individuals will have to adjust to lifestyle changes such as consuming and wasting less and reducing energy usage.  

During the consultation period, members of the public are encouraged to provide their feedback via [go.gov.sg/reach-pc-climate-2022](https://go.gov.sg/reach-pc-climate-2022).
