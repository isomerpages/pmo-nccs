<h4><strong>Singapore’s Triple Transition Towards a Low Carbon Future</strong></h4>
<p>Good morning.&nbsp; I thank the Building and Construction Authority (BCA),
RX, sponsors and partners for the opportunity to join you at the International
Built Environment Week Conference.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THRIVING IN A LOW-CARBON, CLIMATE-IMPAIRED WORLD</strong>
</p>
<p>Let me begin with a quick reflection on the state of the planet.&nbsp;
It is not in a good place. Climate change is already happening. We are
seeing more extreme storms, floods, wildfires, and heat waves. 2024 could
be the world’s hottest year on record. Tropical cyclones are picking up
more energy from warmer ocean waters and intensifying more quickly, leading
to major floods. Droughts have become persistent across many parts of the
world<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>It will only get worse in the coming decades. To mitigate climate change,
we need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial
levels. But global temperatures are already 1.1 degrees Celsius higher
and are continuing to rise<sup>2</sup>. The main driver of global warming
– the emission of greenhouse gases – is also continuing to rise. The climate
crisis – and that is exactly what it is – is gathering pace.</p>
<p>To avert climate catastrophe, the world has been stepping up decarbonisation.
As of June 2023, 149 countries have committed to achieve net-zero emissions<sup>3</sup>.
In the advanced economies, emissions have fallen to their level of 50 years
ago<sup>4</sup>. The share of renewables in global power generation has
been growing over the years and surpassed 30% in 2023<sup>5</sup>.&nbsp;
The global demand for each fossil fuel – coal, oil, and natural gas – is
expected to peak before 2030<sup>6</sup>. Globally, investment in energy
transition technologies has surged from US$240 billion in 2012 to US$1.8
trillion in 2023<sup>7</sup>.</p>
<p>What do these two ongoing trends – climate change and decarbonisation
– mean? It is likely that the world will accelerate the current pace of
decarbonisation in the face of worsening climate change.&nbsp; We will
not sit still. But it is also likely that decarbonisation will not occur
at a fast enough pace to stop climate change.&nbsp; We will not act decisively.</p>
<p>We are thus looking at two scenarios co-existing: a low-carbon world and
a climate-impaired world.&nbsp; These are the two futures that Singapore
needs to prepare for.</p>
<p>Preparing for a low-carbon world is both an international obligation and
an economic necessity. Two years ago, Singapore committed to peak emissions
before 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050.&nbsp; We account for only 0.1%
of global emissions but every country must do its part. The transition
to a low-carbon world will likely entail the biggest economic transformation
since the Industrial Revolution. Those countries, industries, and businesses
that successfully transition towards net-zero will thrive in a low-carbon
world. Singapore must ensure that it is among these countries.</p>
<p>Preparing for a climate-impaired world is an existential issue for Singapore.
We are vulnerable to rising sea levels.&nbsp; We are low-lying, with 30%
of Singapore less than five metres above mean sea levels. We are vulnerable
to severe heat stress.&nbsp; We are a densely populated tropical city subject
to urban heat effects and high humidity. We must ensure that we remain
a resilient, vibrant and liveable city in a climate-impaired world.</p>
<p>Finally, Singapore can and must play a constructive role in Asia’s transition.
Asia accounts for half of global emissions. &nbsp;To mitigate climate change,
Asia needs to decarbonise, and the rest of the world must help it to do
so. As an international business, financial, transportation and technological
hub, Singapore can play a useful role in partnership with others to facilitate
Asia’s transition.</p>
<p>In short, we need to fight on three fronts: drive our own transition to
net-zero; strengthen our resilience to climate change; and facilitate Asia’s
transition to a low-carbon future.</p>
<p><strong>SINGAPORE'S TRIPLE TRANSITION</strong>
</p>
<p>Today, I will focus on Singapore’s transition to net-zero.&nbsp; In fact,
our approach comprises three transitions: a <strong><em>carbon transition</em></strong>;
an <strong><em>energy transition</em></strong>; and an <strong><em>economic transition</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The triple transition will require us to fundamentally rethink the way
we produce and consume.&nbsp; I will discuss each transition in turn, using
the built environment to illustrate.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon Transition</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me start with the carbon transition, to reduce primary carbon emissions
to net-zero across all sectors. As of 2021, primary emissions, or emissions
arising from non-electricity related activities, made up 60% of Singapore’s
total emissions. About 73% of these primary emissions come from industrial
activity and 23% from transportation. Buildings account for about 1.5%,
and households, waste and water, and others account for the rest.</p>
<p>The government has been working with various industries on decarbonisation
plans and mitigation packages. For instance, we are piloting the use of
carbon capture, storage, and utilisation technologies. We are also exploring
the use of low-carbon hydrogen for industrial heating, which is a major
source of emissions in the manufacturing sector. These efforts will take
time. The technologies are nascent, and the cost implications are not trivial.</p>
<p>The land transportation sector’s strategy for decarbonisation is based
on cleaner energy and modal shift. For cleaner energy, we will cease the
registration of new diesel cars and taxis from next year, and install 60,000
charging points for electric vehicles by 2030. As for modal shift, the
aim is for mass public transport to make up 75% of travel at peak hours
by 2030.</p>
<p>For the built environment, the Singapore Green Building Masterplan has
set the target to green 80% of our buildings by 2030. To qualify as green,
buildings not covered under existing Environmental Sustainability Regulations
must be certified under the Green Mark scheme. To obtain Green Mark certification,
a building will have to achieve required energy performance standards along
with other good sustainability practices such as: one, conducting whole-of-life
carbon assessments; two, significantly reducing the embodied carbon in
the building’s concrete, glass and steel; and three, publishing a transition
plan that delineates the steps to deliver a net zero carbon building from
2030.</p>
<p>I am encouraged that building owners are taking decarbonisation seriously.
For example, City Developments Limited has pledged to achieve net zero
carbon by 2030 for all its wholly-owned buildings, through onsite or offsite
renewable energy sources and carbon offsets. Lendlease, a multinational
construction and real estate firm, has set targets to achieve net zero
carbon by 2025, and absolute zero carbon – meaning without using offsets
– by 2040.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Transition</strong>
</p>
<p>Next, the energy transition, to achieve a resilient net-zero electricity
grid and enhance energy efficiency. Electricity generation accounts for
about 40% of Singapore’s total emissions. Of those emissions, the building
sector accounts for nearly one-third. Reducing these emissions is a shared
responsibility: the government must progressively shift to a cleaner energy
mix at the production stage, while the private sector must enhance energy
efficiency at the consumption stage.</p>
<p>Singapore faces significant disadvantages in producing clean energy. Our
average wind speeds are below what is needed for commercial wind turbines.
We have no river system with fast flowing water, limiting our hydroelectric
potential. We have no conventional underground geothermal energy sources.
Solar energy is the most promising option, but its scale is limited by
Singapore’s dense cloud cover and limited land. Even if we reach the full
technical potential for solar deployment by 2050, it will barely meet 10%
of our projected electricity demand.</p>
<p>But we are doing what we can, pursuing multiple avenues to a cleaner grid,
while taking into account energy security and cost competitiveness.</p>
<p>First, we are trying to maximise solar energy through innovative deployment.
Singapore is now home to one of the world’s largest inland floating solar
PV systems. The Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm comprises 122,000 solar
panels and spans across an area of about 45 football fields.</p>
<p>Second, we are looking to import low-carbon electricity from our neighbouring
countries. The Energy Market Authority has granted conditional licenses
to import a total of 2 gigawatts from Indonesia. Conditional approvals
have also been granted to projects importing electricity from Cambodia,
Indonesia, and&nbsp; Vietnam. Just yesterday, we announced that we will
raise our ambition and seek to import 6 gigawatts of low-carbon electricity
by 2035, up from 4 gigawatts previously.</p>
<p>Third, we are exploring hydrogen – and its derivatives such as ammonia
– as a low-carbon energy source. Hydrogen is relevant for both our energy
transition and carbon transition.&nbsp; As a low-carbon energy carrier,
hydrogen produces electricity when combined with oxygen in a fuel cell
or combusted in a gas turbine. As a low-carbon fuel, hydrogen can be used
directly in many industrial processes and transportation. But the technologies
to produce, transport, and use hydrogen are nascent and costly. To realise
the potential of hydrogen, we are: bringing together academia and industry
to scale up hydrogen R&amp;D, and forging international partnerships to
build up hydrogen supply chains.</p>
<p>In particular, Singapore sees strong potential for ammonia – as a hydrogen
carrier as well as a fuel for shipping and power. The Energy Market Authority
and Maritime Port Authority are selecting a lead developer to provide an
end-to-end low-carbon ammonia solution on Jurong Island. If successful,
Singapore will be one of the first countries in the world to directly combust
ammonia for power generation and deploy ammonia bunkering for international
shipping.</p>
<p>Beyond producing cleaner energy, the energy transition is also about enhancing
energy efficiency by users.</p>
<p>The Singapore Green Building Master Plan will hold buildings to high energy
efficiency standards. From 2030, 80% of all new developments by gross floor
area must achieve at least 60% improvement in energy efficiency over 2005
levels. Achieving this standard will contribute towards eligibility for
a bonus gross floor area incentive. Beyond this, BCA will support best-in-class
buildings to achieve 80% improvement in energy efficiency over 2005 levels
by 2030.</p>
<p>Achieving higher energy efficiency in buildings will require advances
in automation systems. Conventional building automation systems are not
intelligent enough to achieve multiple objectives like energy efficiency
and occupant well-being. A so-called model predictive control solution
can do much better, optimising and coordinating air-conditioning, ventilation,
lighting and shading, to achieve energy savings of up to 60%.<strong> </strong>What
started as a research project by the National Technological University
has since been commercialised and deployed at several buildings, including
Jurong Town Hall and the PSA Tuas Port Maintenance Base.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Transition</strong>
</p>
<p>The third transition is economic, to capture new green growth opportunities
and restructure the economy to remain competitive in a low-carbon future.
Decarbonisation will require broader changes in industrial structure, business
processes, and workforce skills.</p>
<p>The economic transition is about greening the brown and growing the green.
We have to progressively decarbonise hard-to-abate carbon-intensive sectors
like semiconductors, chemicals, and maritime services. We also have to
grow new green sectors like carbon services, green and transition finance,
and green ecosystem enablers like Measurement, Reporting and Verification,
or MRV, services. The low-carbon economy of the future is likely to look
quite different from today.</p>
<p>Greening the brown is not just about decarbonising Scope 2 emissions but
also Scope 3. With the International Sustainability Standards Board requiring
Scope 3 reporting, the pressure on companies to clean up their supply chains
will increase. In the built environment sector, Scope 3 forms the lion’s
share of total emissions. These emissions are also hard to abate, like
cement and steel. The challenge for companies in Singapore’s built environment
sector is greater because most of these materials are imported. Our companies
would need to work together across the supply chain to explore ideas and
push innovation in areas such as low-carbon concrete, electric furnaces,
and use of low-carbon hydrogen in steel production. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>KEY ENABLERS FOR THE TRIPLE TRANSITION</strong>
</p>
<p>Achieving the triple transition - in carbon, energy and the economy –
will require several key enablers:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><em>Carbon Pricing</em></strong>.&nbsp; Progressive increases
in carbon taxes will send the right price signals for economy-wide decarbonisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Technology</em></strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many of the barriers
to cost-effective decarbonisation will require significant advances in
climate-related technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Finance</em></strong>.&nbsp; More private capital and innovative
financing instruments will be needed to support the triple transition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Data and Disclosure</em></strong>.&nbsp; The disclosure of
reliable and comparable sustainability data is necessary to guide and sustain
decarbonisation efforts by businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Green Procurement</em></strong>.&nbsp; Incorporating sustainability
considerations in procurement decisions can be a powerful lever for decarbonisation
across supply chains. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me highlight three of the enablers – Technology, Finance, and Data
and Disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Clean Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>To effectively harness technology for decarbonisation, we need to strengthen
collaboration across the public sector, industry, and academia.</p>
<p>The government has been stepping up support for solutions with high levels
of technology readiness. BCA has enhanced the funding under its Green Buildings
Innovation Cluster or GBIC programme to S$45 million. The enhanced programme
will support research into alternative cooling technologies, smart building
solutions, and next-generation building ventilation.</p>
<p>The SMU Connexion building is an interesting project supported by the
GBIC programme, deploying a wide range of sustainable technologies. Their
smart control system integrates building services with networked sensors
for temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide and occupancy. By adjusting
for outdoor weather conditions, the system avoids overcooling – a common
problem in many of our buildings - and thereby minimises energy consumption.
The fans in their air-conditioning units are integrated with CO<sub>2</sub> sensors,
introducing fresh air only when CO<sub>2</sub> levels reach the upper range.
The SMU Connexion building has achieved an energy efficiency improvement
of nearly 65% from the 2005 baseline.</p>
<p>We are also seeing interesting innovations in buildings to better harness
solar energy. At the PSA Tuas Port Maintenance Base, solar PVs are not
just being deployed on rooftops, but also on the building’s vertical façade.
At DBS Newton Green, the PV modules have solar panels on both sides. This
enables harvesting not just the sunlight that falls on the roof but also
the sunlight reflected from the roof surface.</p>
<p><strong>Transition Finance</strong>
</p>
<p>The challenge in financing decarbonisation is not green finance but transition
finance.&nbsp; &nbsp;Getting financing for fully green activities, like
renewable energy deployment, is becoming easier notwithstanding high capital
intensity and long payback periods. But financial institutions find it
more difficult to assess <em>transition</em> activities – activities that
move away from brown but are not yet fully green. Examples include the
switch in electricity generation from coal to natural gas, or the use of
carbon capture for the combustion of fossil fuels. The question around
the pace of decarbonisation is also important. How fast should a company
be transitioning, for it to be considered favourably for financing?</p>
<p>A key enabler for transition finance is international standards. Well-conceived
standards enable financial institutions to more confidently invest in a
company’s decarbonisation.&nbsp; Let me cite an example from the building
sector. An international alliance of leading green building rating system
organisations has launched a guide to help bridge knowledge gaps<sup>8</sup>.
The guide helps institutional investors and financial institutions better
understand major building certification systems, and how those certifications
align with the goals of sustainable finance.</p>
<p>Another enabler is taxonomies. &nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore,
in collaboration with industry, has established the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy
for Sustainable Finance. The taxonomy aims to serve as a common reference
point for financial institutions to inform their financing decisions. It
classifies activities into “green”, “red”, and “amber”, with the last category
of “amber” signifying activities that are credibly transitional in nature,
moving from “red” to “green”. Take for example the renovation of an existing
building: it will be considered “green” if the renovation enables the building
to reach the prevailing Green Mark Certification or align with relevant
Climate Bonds Building Criteria; it will be “amber” or transition if the
renovation leads to at least a 30% reduction in emissions or energy consumption
up to the category’s sunset date of 2030. It will be “red” if it does not
meet the above criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Data and Disclosure</strong>
</p>
<p>Finally, data and disclosure. What gets measured gets done and what gets
disclosed gets done even better. The disclosure of reliable and comparable
sustainability data is a powerful tool to accelerate the triple transitions.
It enables companies to benchmark themselves to their competitors. It enhances
supply chain accountability and management of Scope 3 emissions. It helps
governments to prioritise their decarbonisation efforts. It helps sectoral
regulators to calibrate their emissions or efficiency-related requirements.
It enables financial institutions to make more informed sustainable financing
decisions.</p>
<p>As a key step towards a robust data and disclosure ecosystem, Singapore
will introduce mandatory climate-related reporting. From FY2025, all listed
issuers will be required to make annual climate-related disclosures, aligned
with ISSB standards. From FY2027, all companies with annual revenue of
at least $1 billion and total assets of at least $500 million will be required
to do the same.</p>
<p>BCA has taken steps to increase the transparency of buildings’ energy
performance. Building owners can benchmark the performance of their buildings
to the top quartile of buildings in Singapore using the BCA’s Building
Energy Benchmarking Report.</p>
<p><strong>CLIMATE RESILIENCE</strong>
</p>
<p>I have not touched on adaptation and resilience strategies to deal with
the physical effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Even as it plans for the triple transition, the built environment sector
must prepare for climate resilience. Many of Singapore’s climate vulnerabilities,
like heat stress and rising sea levels, will have a significant impact
on the built environment. This is why all new developments are required
to be built on higher platforms, at least four metres above mean sea levels.
Critical infrastructure will be built an additional metre higher. The sector
must also prepare for the effects of heat stress on related industries
like construction. As our climate continues to deteriorate, even more adaptation
measures may be required in the built environment sector in future. In
short, resilience must become an integral part of our transition planning.</p>
<p><strong>THE FOURTH TRANSITION</strong>
</p>
<p>I have spoken about our triple transition – carbon, energy, and economic.&nbsp;
I have also touched on three key enablers for this transition – technology,
finance, and data and disclosure.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a fourth transition that the world and Singapore need
to make – a transition in mindsets. It begins with building awareness –
that climate change is no longer a prediction but a current reality that
will progressively worsen. We need to transition from short-term thinking
to long-term thinking. The time for action is not 2030 or 2050, but now.&nbsp;
&nbsp;We need to transition from viewing carbon as a constraint on economic
growth to viewing low-carbon as a source of competitive advantage. This
is how many of the most progressive companies in the world are approaching
the issue. We need to transition from seeing decarbonisation purely as
a cost to seeing it as an investment in future growth. Finally, we need
to transition from considerations based purely on self-interest to collective
interest.</p>
<p>We must transition because it is the right thing to do – for our people
and our planet.</p>
