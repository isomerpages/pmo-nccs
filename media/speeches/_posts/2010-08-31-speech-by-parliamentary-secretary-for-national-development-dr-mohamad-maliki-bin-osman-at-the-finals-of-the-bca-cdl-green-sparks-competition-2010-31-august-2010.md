Ladies and Gentlemen

1.A very good afternoon to all of you.

2.It is my pleasure to be here at the Finals of the BCA-CDL Green Sparks Competition 2010. This competition, which is jointly organised by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and City Developments Limited (CDL), has attracted a total of 20 teams comprising 152 students from 5 tertiary institutions. It is a first-of-its-kind green building competition which brings about fresh ideas and innovation among our youths.

**Significance of the Competition**  
3.This competition is significant and meaningful in two ways. First, the competition tackles a real issue which BCA is currently addressing. The building sector in Singapore consumes a third of our national end-use electricity. In particular, we need to explore ways to make our existing buildings more energy efficient, as they comprise the bulk of the building stock in Singapore.

4.I am delighted to see various retrofitting ideas which showcase different ways of implementing green solutions to achieve greater energy efficiency for the office environment. I hope that you now have a better understanding of the challenges and possibilities of improving the environmental sustainability of existing buildings. The competition also benefits BCA as your passion and creativity has given us a fresh and innovative perspective on green building solutions for the future.

5.Second, this competition shows the commitment of our developers such as City Developments Limited, to strive for higher Green Mark ratings and support the green movement. Although Fuji Xerox Towers has already obtained the Green Mark Gold rating, CDL is committed to achieving the highest rating - the Green Mark Platinum award for this building in order to obtain better energy savings. It demonstrates that there is a strong business case for greening existing buildings.

**Promotion of Green Buildings to Youths**  
6.I am encouraged by the partnership between our industry players and BCA. By working together, we can help shape Singapore as a sustainable and liveable city, and raise awareness of green building technologies and lifestyle among the younger generation.

7.Besides holding this competition with CDL, BCA has also embarked on a public awareness campaign through its roving green building exhibitions. The first public exhibition was held at CDL’s City Square Mall in December last year. In conjunction with the Singapore Green Building Week this September, the fourth run of the exhibition will be held at Marina Square during the September school holidays. BCA has also started a Facebook page to promote green buildings among our youths.

8.Extending this competition to our tertiary students is timely as we hear innovative ideas from our youths. They are the key stake holders in this endeavor as the future belongs to them. Seeding the sense of ownership of the environment and in today’s context the kinds of buildings we can and should have in the future bodes well for us as a country.

**Future of the Green Building Industry**  
9.Singapore is a small city-state with a high population density. We must all play our part to protect our environment and tackle the effects of global warming. To transform the building sector and make it more energy efficient, BCA has launched various initiatives under its Green Building Masterplan.

10.In Singapore, we estimate that about 18,000 to 20,000 “green” building professionals will be needed in the coming years to support the design, construction, operation and management of green buildings. The growing importance of green buildings and its economic spin-offs are not confined to Singapore. Our green building professionals will also have opportunities overseas, as countries across the world are similarly exploring ways to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions.

**Conclusion**  
11.To the students who are here today, I would like to encourage you to consider a ‘green’ profession as your future career. This is a satisfying career as it enables you to play your part in mitigating the effects of climate change and shaping a sustainable Singapore for our future generations. You can offer a continuous pipeline of innovative ideas to tackle the complex problem of global warming not just for Singapore, but also for the rest of the world.

12.You can also be advocates and ambassadors, reaching out to your peers in promoting a higher understanding and appreciation of environmental sustainability issues for your own future.

13.Let me conclude by congratulating all the contestants on a job well done. I wish you every success in your studies and careers ahead.

14.Thank you.
