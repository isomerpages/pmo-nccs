各位贵宾,  
女士们先生们,  
(Distinguished Guests,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,)

1.&nbsp;下午好！能够出席中国广东核电集团新加坡项目的发布会，本人倍感荣幸！我知道，这包含了中广核集团光电生物质能一体化发电项目以及太阳能业务的区域总部。谨此对中广核集团在新加坡的计划表示最衷心的祝贺！这无论对中广核集团或者新加坡洁净能源产业来说，都是一个重大的里程碑。  
(Good afternoon. I am delighted to join you today for China Guangdong Nuclear Power Holding Corporation or CGNPC’s announcement of its Integrated Solar-Biomass Power Generation Project, as well as regional headquarters for its solar business in Singapore.)

2.&nbsp;由于在场的贵宾覆盖着多元化的背景与语言，我接下来将用英语致词。  
(As our audience here is diverse and multi-lingual, I will deliver my speech in English.)

3.&nbsp;Good afternoon. I am delighted to join you today for China Guangdong Nuclear Power Holding Corporation or CGNPC’s announcement of its Integrated Solar-Biomass Power Generation Plant, as well as regional headquarters for its solar business in Singapore.

4.&nbsp;CGNPC is one of China’s major state-owned enterprises and had diversified into the development of clean energy in 2007. We are glad that the company has chosen Singapore for its first international investment outside China to globalise its clean energy businesses.

5.&nbsp;The rise of Asia has enabled Asian corporations to grow rapidly in their home countries, and to explore new markets in Asia and other parts of the world. Asia has also been recognized as a major player in the provision and adoption of clean energy research and technologies. A recent survey conducted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers or “IEEE” showed that as of 2009, more companies in Asia hold cleantech patents compared to other regions around the world. This reflects Asia’s position as a front-runner in the development of clean technology solutions.

6.&nbsp;With a strong focus on innovation and a highly-skilled, cosmopolitan workforce, Singapore is well-placed to serve as a neutral strategic base for Asian enterprises to build their global presence and develop cleantech solutions. Companies can demonstrate and commercialise new solutions here to address challenges associated with urbanisation and sustainable development. This is made possible by the creation of real-life testing platforms such as the Cleantech Park, the region’s first eco-business park which will host 20,000 green-collar professionals when fully completed in 2030.

7.&nbsp;As a reflection of our strong commitment to innovation, Singapore has allocated about S$700 million of funding to develop the sector. A comprehensive blueprint is also in place to grow a vibrant industry ecosystem through R&D, manpower development and grooming of Singapore-based enterprises. The Cleantech industry is expected to contribute S$3.4 billion to Singapore’s GDP and employ some 18,000 people by 2015.

8.&nbsp;CGNPC’s announcement today affirms the attractiveness of Singapore as an internationalisation platform for Cleantech companies from China, now regarded as a global leader in sustainable energy. Just two months ago, Hanlong Group, a leading privately-owned industrial conglomerate from China, announced its investment of US$100 million to set up the International HQ for its solar operations in Singapore.

9.&nbsp;CGNPC’s investment will further enhance Singapore’s thriving Cleantech ecosystem. We are confident that there will be many more Chinese Cleantech companies undertaking regional or even global headquarters, R&D and supply chain management activities in Singapore.

10.&nbsp;Last but not least, I would like to thank CGNPC for its trust and confidence in Singapore. We will continue to support CGNPC’s efforts and look forward to forging a strong long-term partnership with you. Once again, congratulations to the management and staff of CGNPC and I wish you success and growth in the coming years. Thank you.

11.&nbsp;最后，我衷心地感谢中广核集团对新加坡的信心和信赖。我们期望以这项目为基础，继续与贵公司增强成功的合作关系。我谨再次向谭总经理、中广核集团的领导和员工们表示最衷心的祝贺！祝愿你们马到成功！谢谢大家！
