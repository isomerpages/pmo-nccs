### SPEECH BY MR LIM HNG KIANG MINISTER FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY AT THE OPENING CEREMONY OF CLEANTECH ONE

Dr Loo Choon Yong, Chairman, JTC

Distinguished Guests,

Ladies and Gentlemen

**INTRODUCTION**

I am delighted to be here with you today for the official opening of CleanTech One, the first building in CleanTech Park.

**SINGAPORE'S LEADING ROLE IN A GROWING CLEANTECH SECTOR**

The issue of environmental sustainability is increasingly a key concern of many governments and companies. This has spurred the growth of the global cleantech market, which now stands at around US$1 trillion annually.

In addition to the core cleantech sectors of water, environment, clean energy and energy efficiency, sectors such as Information Technology, professional and financial services, as well as building materials and construction, are developing new businesses to tap into this large market.

Given this market's potential, Singapore identified the water, environment, and clean energy industries as key growth areas. They are expected to contribute S$3.4 billion to Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) and provide 18,000 jobs by 2015.

Our efforts in developing the cleantech industries have gathered much momentum. Today, Singapore is recognised as a leading global hydrohub with more than 100 water companies. Within the Asia-Pacific region itself, we are also the business hub for many international clean energy companies, some of which have chosen to locate their operations here at CleanTech One.

**CREATING AN ECOSYSTEM FOR CLEANTECH INNOVATION**

To propel Singapore forward in this growing industry, we need to create an ecosystem to nurture, anchor and also to commercialise innovation. To achieve this, Singapore has mapped out a "whole-of-government" blueprint.

In terms of funding, the National Research Foundation (NRF) has allocated $195 million to the Energy Innovation Programme Office (EIPO) and $470 million to the Environment and Water Industry Programme Office (EWI) to plan and develop the cleantech sector in Singapore.

As SMEs form the core of our cleantech sector, we have also paid special attention to helping aspiring SMEs gain a strong foothold and move forward. The Centre of Innovation for Environmental & Water Technology was set up in 2006 to help local cleantech enterprises move up the technology value chain. To give an added boost for these SMEs, global intellectual property firm 360iP and NTU will jointly help develop and commercialise intellectual property for the cleantech industry. With this initiative, SMEs in the cleantech sector will have more affordable access to R&D services and infrastructure.

The creation of this cleantech ecosystem is an important part of Singapore's efforts to combine the considerations of environmental sustainability and economic development, and pursue what we have termed "Green Growth".

However, the development of the ecosystem will require more than funding. Companies will need to be supported by the right infrastructure and a conducive environment to interact, innovate and thrive. In other words, this Ecosystem will need a home. CleanTech Park was conceived to be the choice home for R&D and business activities involving cleantech and sustainable urban solutions.

**A DYNAMIC CLEANTECH COMMUNITY AND LIVING LAB: THE CLEANTECH PARK VALUE PROPOSITION**

I am therefore pleased to hear from Dr Loo that several leading cleantech companies and research institutes have chosen CleanTech One, the first building in CleanTech Park, to be their home. Indeed, having cleantech companies work alongside academic research institutes in a dynamic community is one of the unique value propositions of CleanTech One. This will open up collaboration opportunities. For example, DHI, Toray and Aquaporin have chosen to locate their facilities here to leverage on the close proximity with the Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute, or NEWRI in short. Today, these companies are engaged in industry-oriented research partnerships to develop cleantech applications and systems.

Looking ahead, CleanTech Two, the second building in CleanTech Park to be completed in end 2014, will strengthen business to business collaboration in R&D in CleanTech Park. CleanTech Two will host the Advanced Remanufacturing & Technology Centre or ARTC, which is made up of a unique nexus of industry players, both MNCs and SMEs and public research institutes. I am encouraged to learn that ARTC has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with industry leaders such as Rolls-Royce, Boeing and Siemens to translate remanufacturing and advanced technologies to the industry through public-private partnerships.

Businesses also recognize CleanTech Park's other unique value proposition as a vibrant living laboratory. CleanTech One is already a thriving hotbed of ideas and urban solutions in the areas of resource efficiency, sustainability and building efficiency. These ideas and solutions are test-bedded and sharpened here before commercialisation.

In fact, the test-bedding opportunities extend beyond buildings. Companies can also test-bed estate-level urban cleantech solutions within the Park as well as in the adjacent NTU campus. For example, JTC has been actively inviting companies to test-bed LED street lightings on the roads in CleanTech Park under the LED Challenge.

JTC will be riding on the success of CleanTech One's programme to explore such test-bedding opportunities across its industrial estates. This will open up yet another avenue for the industry to partner JTC in its innovation drive.

I share Dr Loo's excitement about the promising beginnings of the CleanTech Park community and I commend JTC for initiating the development of this cleantech eco-system. The linkages forged as companies interact and collaborate here will spur the cleantech industry in Singapore to the next level.

**CONCLUSION**

With this green ecosystem taking shape, I am confident that CleanTech Park will lead the way in creating a conducive and sustainable environment within which cleantech businesses can thrive.

I wish JTC and the tenants of CleanTech One every success as they continue to push the boundaries of innovation and scale new heights. Thank you.
