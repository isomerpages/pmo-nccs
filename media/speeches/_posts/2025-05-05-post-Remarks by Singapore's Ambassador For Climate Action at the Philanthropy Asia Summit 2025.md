<p><strong>REMARKS BY SINGAPORE’S AMBASSADOR FOR CLIMATE ACTION AT THE PHILANTHROPY ASIA SUMMIT 2025, MARINA BAY SANDS, SINGAPORE, 5 MAY 2025<em>&nbsp;</em></strong>
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Insights: Where Climate Stands</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>The climate agenda is facing headwinds, not just in the US, but everywhere.</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Concerns about cost of living and job security rank high in people’s minds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses are reviewing their sustainability goals amid heightened economic
uncertainty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governments are recalibrating their climate commitments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Ultimately, nature sets the timeline for climate action, not electoral or business cycles.</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Extreme weather events – wildfires, floods, and heatwaves – are becoming
more frequent and more severe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The worst is yet to come, as glaciers recede, ocean currents weaken, and
the polar ice caps melt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will be forced to act.&nbsp; But the longer we delay, the more disorderly
the eventual transition will be.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Climate action will be critical in Asia – for two reasons.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>First, Asia is where the fight against climate change will be won or lost.</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Asia accounts for 50% of global emissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>90% of the world’s future growth in energy demand will come from Asia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than 150 million people in Asia still lack access to electricity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without decarbonising Asia, the world will not reach net zero.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Second, Asia will suffer the most from climate change – lives and livelihoods.</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>By 2080, over 1 billion people in South and Southeast Asia could be affected
by extreme heat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asia’s climate-induced losses could reach about 40% of GDP by 2100.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Yet, Asia remains severely underfunded to drive decarbonisation and build climate resilience</em></strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Asia’s funding gap for climate mitigation and adaptation stands at over
800 billion US dollars annually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public capital is willing but insufficient.&nbsp; Private capital is ample
but unwilling to commit in a big way because the risks are too high.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>This is a time for philanthropy to play a larger role in driving climate action in Asia.</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A partnership across public, private, and philanthropic capital can help
to effectively plugs the gaps in Asia’s climate finance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>But the climate philanthropic space remains at a nascent stage.</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Globally, less than 2% of philanthropic giving goes towards preventing
climate change. Of this, only 12% goes to Asia, despite the region’s outsized
needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When engaging philanthropies, I often hear that they are unsure where
to direct their resources in the climate space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let me outline three areas where I think philanthropic capital can support climate action.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Crowding in private capital</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enabling public goods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring just transition</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>First, crowding in private capital for decarbonisation projects.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Decarbonisation projects are often capital-intensive and require large
upfront investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This goes beyond the capacity of any single stakeholder.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Philanthropies can leverage innovative funding instruments such as blended finance to maximise the impact of their contributions</em></strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The premise of blended finance is to use concessional capital to de-risk
and crowd in commercial capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This concessional layer - coming from public and philanthropic capital
- accepts first-loss and lower returns, thereby catalysing significantly
more private capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared to direct grants, blended finance allows philanthropies to amplify
the impact of their giving.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Let me make a pitch for Singapore’s FAST-P or Financing Asia’s Transition Partnership.</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>FAST-P is a blended finance platform to support green and transition projects
in Asia – from phasing out coal and strengthening grid infrastructure to
electrifying transportation and decarbonising industrial processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Singapore Government has pledged 500 million US dollars as concessional
capital to be matched dollar for dollar by other sources of concessional
capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aim is to use this 1 billion dollar base of concessional capital to
crowd in four times more private capital for a total fund size of 5 billion
US dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FAST-P has already attracted philanthropic funds from partners such as
the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, the Asian Development
Bank, and Allied Climate Partners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second, enabling public goods for climate action</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Many parts of Southeast Asia lack sufficient climate data, hindering mitigation
and adaptation efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Philanthropies can fund data collection, enhance access, and build local
capacity in data analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me share three specific examples where philanthropies can help.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>The Global Mitigation Potential Atlas is a digital tool which identifies cost-effective emissions reduction opportunities.</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Developed by an international consortium of researchers and piloted in
nine Southeast Asian countries, it is now being expanded to the US, China
and Australia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workshops have been conducted for officials in Southeast Asia on using
this tool to help develop actionable decarbonisation policies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>The Climate Action Data Trust is a digital platform which enhances transparency in carbon markets.</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Established by Singapore, the World Bank, and the International Emissions
Trading Association, the platform aggregates and standardises carbon credit
data, covering 85% of all credits issued globally.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>The Cambodia-Mekong Delta Aquifer Project uses science-based assessments to address sustainability challenges in the Lower Mekong Basin</em></strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Funded by the Global Environment Facility, this project aims to enhance
resilience in agriculture, drinking water and biodiversity for millions
in Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Philanthropies are in a good position to work with the scientific community
and national authorities on transboundary climate risk assessments that
often fall through the cracks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third, ensuring a just transition for communities.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>The transition to a low-carbon economy will disrupt communities and livelihoods</em></strong>.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Decarbonisation entails changes in long-standing economic activities –
be it changing agricultural practices or phasing out fossil fuel power
generation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to re-skill workers and empower communities to ensure they are
able to navigate the transition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Philanthropies are well-placed to support just transition given their
experience working directly with communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me share two examples of just transition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory seeks to decarbonise rice cultivation
while securing the livelihoods of smallholder farmers by improving food
security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Coal-to-Clean Credits Initiative has stipulated that 2% of the revenues
from carbon credits generated by the early phase-out of coal should go
into redeploying displaced coal workers to new jobs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Let me conclude.</p>
<p>Amid the disruptions entailed by the transition to a lower carbon world,
we need philanthropy to help communities successfully navigate the change.</p>
<p>Amid the growing risks to lives and livelihoods from the climate crisis,
we need philanthropy to help communities adapt and thrive.</p>
<p>Philanthropy cannot do all this alone. Governments must play their part.&nbsp;
The business community and private capital must step up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But philanthropy can be the catalyst to forge new partnerships, to enable
the collective action necessary to safeguard the future of our planet and
its people.</p>
<p>The Greek root of the word philanthropy means <em>“love for humanity”.&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>And this is what philanthropy brings to the table: where there is division
and fragmentation, to be a force for the collective good of humanity.</p>
