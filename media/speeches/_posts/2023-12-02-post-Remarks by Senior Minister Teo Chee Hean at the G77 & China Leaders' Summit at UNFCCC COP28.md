**Remarks by Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean at the G77 & China Leaders' Summit at UNFCCC COP28**

Good afternoon.

I thank the G77 and China for the invitation to speak at this event.

Climate change is the greatest challenges of our time. The frequency and ferocity of climate change-induced weather events continue to rise.

Developing countries have the least responsibility for historical emissions, but are the most vulnerable to its consequences. This is particularly so for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) such as Singapore. Although Singapore emits less than 0.1% of global emissions, our low-lying island nation will be acutely impacted by the changing climate.

Sea levels are expected to rise by up to a metre by the end of the century, encroaching on our coastlines and increasing the risks of floods. We are only 40km from east to west, 20km from north to south, with more than five and a half million people. So we really have no where to go if our coastlines recede.

Singapore is thus committed to doing our part, but a global issue like climate change requires a global response.

This is why we have always been a strong supporter of a multilateral approach, and why we keenly support the G77 and Chinaâ€™s unwavering commitment to the Paris Agreement process. This commitment is crucial for keeping the 1.5 degree target within reach.

At COP28, we hope to see the first Global Stocktake galvanise Parties to step up our collective climate ambition.

Singapore is the co-facilitator of the Joint Contact Group together with the UK. We looks forward to constructive discussions in the coming days. We also hope to advance regional and international cooperation on implementation.

Close collaboration between countries will be necessary in the search for needle-moving, low-emissions solutions like hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Strong partnerships between the public and private sectors will also be critical for success.

Finally, we look forward to seeing the operationalisation of the loss and damage fund, which will provide support for developing countries that are disproportionately burdened by the climate crisis. Singapore is committed to supporting our fellow developing countries in implementing their climate strategies.

Under the Singapore Cooperation Programme, which is our flagship technical assistance programme, we have trained about 150,000 officials from over 180 countries. And we will continue to do our part. We will actively continue to pursue opportunities to deepen international cooperation.

I look forward to fruitful discussions. Thank you very much Mr Chairman.
