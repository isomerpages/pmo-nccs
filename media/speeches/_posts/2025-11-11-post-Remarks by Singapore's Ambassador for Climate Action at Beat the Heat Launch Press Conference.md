<p><strong>REMARKS BY SINGAPORE'S AMBASSADOR FOR CLIMATE ACTION AT 2025 GLOBAL COOLING WATCH REPORT AND BEAT THE HEAT LAUNCH PRESS CONFERENCE PROGRAMME</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Singapore - Advancing Global Action for Heat Resilience and Sustainable Cooling</strong>
</p>
<p>Excellencies, colleagues and friends from the media,</p>
<p>I would like to commend Brazil and UNEP for convening this vital initiative
and for the launch of the Global Cooling Watch report. Today’s moment underlines
that heat is no longer a local nuisance—it is a systemic, long-term risk
with regional and global consequences.</p>
<p>Singapore is a small, densely urbanised island, but our experience points
to a universal truth: rising heat undermines public health, productivity,
supply chains and critical infrastructure — and its impacts are felt across
national borders. Heat stress reduces labour capacity, strains electricity
systems at times of peak demand, compromises food storage and transport,
and can amplify humanitarian pressures that ripple across regions. That
is why heat is a global commons issue and requires coordinated, scalable
solutions.</p>
<p>Singapore’s priority has been to translate science into practical public
goods that others can use. We invest in robust climate projections and
decision-grade tools, convene multi-stakeholder partnerships, and pursue
policy pathways that crowd in private investment and public-sector rollout.
Where we can add value to the global effort is by sharing those capabilities—data,
modelling, governance frameworks and platforms for peer learning—so cities
and nations can move from plans to projects at speed.</p>
<p>Beat the Heat is precisely the vehicle we need: a mechanism to turn pledges
into implementation, to de-risk investment, and to diffuse scalable solutions
across contexts. Singapore will support this drive by facilitating knowledge
exchange, convening focal points for practical collaboration, and offering
technical capabilities that can be adapted for other cities.</p>
<p>Minister Grace Fu will set out more details on 18 November at the Global
Cooling Pledge Ministerial Roundtable about how we will deepen collaboration.
For now, let us be clear: tackling heat is not optional — it is a shared
responsibility. By pooling expertise, standardising tools and partnering
at scale, we can protect our people and economies while keeping our low-carbon
transition on track.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
