<p><strong>REMARKS BY SINGAPORE’S AMBASSADOR FOR CLIMATE ACTION AT BEAT THE HEAT AND GLOBAL COOLING WATCH REPORT LAUNCH, BELÉM, BRAZIL, 11 NOVEMBER 2025</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<p>Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>I commend Brazil and UNEP for launching this initiative to strengthen
heat resilience and the <em>Global Cooling Watch</em> report.</p>
<p>Heat is not just a local nuisance. With global temperatures continuing
to rise, it is a systemic risk with global consequences. According to IPCC
AR6, about 1 billion people in South and Southeast Asia could be affected
by extreme heat.</p>
<p>Heat stress undermines public health, reduces labour productivity, strains
electricity systems at times of peak demand, compromises food storage and
transport, and can amplify humanitarian pressures that ripple across regions.</p>
<p>As a highly urbanised city-state in the tropics, Singapore takes a serious
view of these risks. By 2100, temperatures in Singapore are expected to
exceed 35 degrees Celsius almost every day.</p>
<p>We are ramping up our heat resilience.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We are investing in robust climate projections to better understand the
risks posed by extreme heat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have formulated national heatwave response plans for both the general
public and specific groups which are more vulnerable to heat stress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are developing innovative solutions such as cool paint for buildings
and cooling vests for outdoor work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are taking a regional perspective to enhance our collective capacity
for a heat resilient Southeast Asia.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We look forward to contribute to global efforts to strengthen heat resilience
by sharing our knowledge and capabilities as well as learning from the
experience of others.</p>
<p><em>Beat the Heat</em> is precisely the vehicle the world needs: a mechanism
to turn pledges into implementation, to de-risk investment, and to diffuse
scalable solutions across countries.</p>
<p>Minister Grace Fu will set out more details on 18 November at the Global
Cooling Pledge Ministerial Roundtable on how we can deepen collaboration
in heat resilience.</p>
<p>Thank you to Brazil and UNEP for reminding us that:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>tackling heat is not optional — it is a necessity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is not a local issue, it is a shared responsibility.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us pool our expertise, strengthen our tools, and scale our solutions
through deeper partnerships for a more climate-resilient world.</p>
