<p><strong>Keynote Address by Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean at Ecosperity on 6 May 2025</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Asia’s Climate Battle: Mobilising Regional Action for a Sustainable Future</strong></h4>
<p>Mr Lim Boon Heng, Chairman of Temasek Holdings,
<br>Excellencies,
<br>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p></p>
<p>We meet at a time of deepening global uncertainty.</p>
<p>The international trading order has been upended. Supply chains are being
redrawn. Global leadership is in flux, giving rise to a more arbitrary,
protectionist, and dangerous world.</p>
<p>As a result, countries are reassessing their priorities, placing renewed
emphasis on economic resilience, self-sufficiency, and strategic autonomy.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, it is not surprising to hear calls for climate
ambition to be rolled back or at least deferred. Governments and businesses
are under pressure to focus on immediate concerns: preserving jobs, securing
supply chains, and deepening reserves in anticipation of potential shocks.</p>
<p>But we must be clear-minded. Those of you who run organisations know that
long-term success requires both a firm grasp on the demands of today, and
a steady eye on the needs of tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Asia: Epicentre of the climate battle</strong>
</p>
<p>The reality is that climate change will not wait for the world to find
its footing. Nature sets the pace, not us, and will not wait for countries
and business to act. The impact of climate change is increasingly apparent,
and Asia will be among the hardest hit.</p>
<p>If global temperatures continue to rise at the current rate, Asia’s economic
future will be in severe jeopardy if we do not do anything. The Asian Development
Bank estimates that Asia could see losses of up to 41% of GDP by 2100,
under a high emissions scenario.<sup>1</sup> Southeast Asia will be hit
particularly hard. By 2030, three quarters of Southeast Asian cities could
face regular flooding, potentially displacing tens of millions.<sup>2</sup> Heat
and extreme weather will disrupt food supplies, raise health issues, and
strain public systems. It is clear that our region will bear the full brunt
of climate impacts.</p>
<p>Yet, it is also here, in Asia, that the fight against climate change will
be won or lost. Our region is not just vulnerable to the crisis. We are
integral to solving it.</p>
<p>In a reversal of historical emission levels, Asia today accounts for more
than half of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<sup>3</sup> In contrast, the
US and Europe combined now contribute only a quarter of global emissions.<sup>4 </sup>And
as the economics of renewables improves, if the US and Europe continue
to deploy more renewables, their share of global emissions will continue
to fall.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, emissions per capita in the US are about triple that of
Asia. Europe’s are about one-and-half times Asia’s. And this reflects the
energy consumption of each of these regions.<sup>5</sup> So, while Asia
is expected to account for 90% of the world’s future growth in energy demand,<sup>6</sup> this
growth is a necessary consequence of improving people’s lives, reducing
poverty, and ensuring that underserved communities get access to reliable
electricity. This also means that, without mitigation, Asia’s emissions
trajectory is likely to be upward, if the demand for energy continues to
grow. It is within our hands to shape this.</p>
<p>The way in which Asia sources for our energy – whether from fossil fuels
or renewables – and how we decarbonise, will shape not only our own trajectory,
but that of the entire world.</p>
<p><strong>Regional collaboration for a low-carbon future</strong>
</p>
<p>So, what should the path forward for Asia be?</p>
<p>One set of actions prioritises mitigation solutions that are already available,
can reduce emissions, and also strengthen economic competitiveness. Here,
the green choice already coincides with the economic choice. These are
should-do, must-do, no-regrets moves. Examples include energy efficient
building systems, vehicular and industrial electrification, and large-scale
solar and wind deployments. This set of actions will continue to grow.
As green technologies mature, their economics will improve, and market
players will respond because it is in their inherent commercial interest
to do so.</p>
<p>Another set of actions involves governments, businesses, and investors
collaborating to close the gap between what is green and what makes economic
sense. In other words, for jurisdictions and stakeholders with different
comparative advantages to put these complementarities to use by working
with each other.</p>
<p>If Southeast Asia can work more closely together – across governments,
businesses, and investors – we will be able to realise a low-carbon future.
Let me touch on just three areas where deeper collaboration can drive growth,
resilience, and climate action.</p>
<p><strong>Advancing the regional energy transition</strong>
</p>
<p>First, regional grids. Southeast Asia has immense renewable potential
– solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal resources are abundant. Yet the uptake
remains limited, because poor grid connectivity prevents clean energy from
reaching where it is needed most. As the saying goes, “there is no transition,
without transmission”. This is within countries, like large, archipelagic
Indonesia, and also between Southeast Asian countries.</p>
<p>An integrated ASEAN power grid is part of the answer. By connecting national
grids, we can trade renewable energy across borders. This will cut fossil
fuel reliance and also importantly, strengthen regional energy resilience
at a time when world markets are prone to gyrations.</p>
<p>We are already making progress. Last year, electricity trade under the
Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project doubled from
100 to 200 megawatts.<sup>7</sup> This is really quite small in the scheme
of things, but it is a useful pathfinder of what can be achieved. Singapore
has also progressed agreements to trade green electricity with our neighbours,
including Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia.</p>
<p>The regional energy transition requires more than just better grid connectivity,
but it is a key enabler. With continued investment and cross-border cooperation,
an ASEAN grid could lift GDP by up to 4.6% and create thousands of green
jobs.<sup>8</sup>
</p>
<p><strong>Unlocking Financing</strong>
</p>
<p>Second, we must close the financing gap. If renewables are going to power
our green future, then financing will be needed to “power” the transition
to that future. Financing is critical for clean energy deployment, infrastructural
adaptation, and the transformation of economies. Without sufficient financing,
the drive to decarbonise will sputter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Southeast Asia faces a significant financing gap for green
investments, this is estimated at over US$210 billion annually through
to 2030.<sup>9</sup> Many governments in our region face budget pressures.
The private sector has resources to deploy, but is understandably wary
about the risks and returns of green investments.</p>
<p>To move forward, Asia needs innovative financial solutions involving stronger
public-private partnerships. Blended finance can be a powerful tool, as
it helps to de risk investments and makes projects more attractive to commercial
investors.</p>
<p>To kickstart this, Singapore has launched the Financing Asia’s Transition
Partnership, or FAST-P, which aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion to finance
green projects. We have seen encouraging progress. The Monetary Authority
of Singapore will provide an update on this tomorrow.</p>
<p>We hope this spurs businesses, investors, and governments to go further
to crowd in capital from within the region, and direct it toward credible
green projects.</p>
<p>This will help Southeast Asia close its large green financing gap, accelerate
the low-carbon transition, spark innovation, and create jobs for a sustainable
future.</p>
<p><strong>Realising the region’s carbon market potential</strong>
</p>
<p>In much the same way that a regional grid will help unlock the region’s
green energy potential, the development of high-integrity carbon markets
can help unlock another area of potential for the region: nature-based
carbon solutions.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia is home to some of the world’s richest ecosystems – 15%
of the world’s tropical forests, more than a fifth of the world’s mangroves,
and 23 million hectares of peatlands.<sup>10</sup> Recently, the Integrity
Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) – a well-known international
organisation for carbon credit supply side integrity – approved several
methodologies to support high integrity carbon credits that reduce emissions
from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries. This
shows that credible nature-based carbon credits are possible.</p>
<p>Carbon credits can also help drive energy decarbonisation. Asia’s existing
coal fired power plants, if left operational, will consume about two-thirds
of the carbon budget available for the world to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius
target. Carbon credits, in the form of transition credits, can be a powerful
lever to improve the economics of coal plant phase out. Singapore supports
this effort through the Transition Credits Coalition (TRACTION), convened
by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
<p>For carbon markets to work, trust in the integrity of these markets is
key. This is why Singapore is committed to working closely with governments,
businesses, standards bodies, and international organisations to develop
global standards and frameworks that uphold quality and integrity. We want
to set a high bar for the credits we support, and lead the way towards
credible carbon markets.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>Let me close with some final thoughts on what I see as the overall trajectory
of climate action.</p>
<p>I began chairing Singapore’s Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change
in 2011 – almost 15 years ago. The scientific evidence has become clear
over this period, and is overwhelmingly accepted: human activities are
accelerating climate change. The climate journey has never been smooth,
especially with the US pulling out of the Paris Agreement again. But there
are good reasons for us, Singapore, a small island nation, with limited
natural and alternative energy sources, to strive harder for a green future.
Let me explain why.</p>
<p>First, politics. Despite the ebbs and flows across election cycles and
administrations, the trend has been towards more global collaboration and
cooperation. Climate sceptics and climate zealots still battle it out.
But the conversation has shifted from whether humans are responsible:–
to who should act and how much, rather than whether we should act at all.
In Singapore, we are not climate zealots, we are not climate sceptics,
we are climate realists. We cannot be sure what other countries will or
will not do. But we will secure Singapore’s future – by doing our part
and collaborating with the world to reduce emissions; by readying our economy
to grasp the new opportunities in a low-carbon world; and by preparing
to protect ourselves from the effects of a warmer world, effects such as
sea level rise.</p>
<p>Second, economics. Green technology has advanced dramatically in the last
two decades. Several of these technologies are now mature and mainstream,
and make economic sense on their own – they are not just cleaner but lower
cost. These technologies continue to march forward. This means that the
economics will tip further in favour of greener choices. Countries and
businesses realise this, which is why, despite political perturbances,
there is now much greater momentum to decarbonise than just a decade ago.</p>
<p>Third, nature. Climate change is no longer a future threat; it is already
here. Every country, all of us, can see this – drought, fires, floods,
loss of crop yields, more severe storms. Climate change will not wait for
us to be ready. The longer we delay, the more abrupt and harder our transition
will be. That is why Singapore is moving forward.</p>
<p>Singapore is committed to achieving our transition, and supporting regional
efforts to do so. We recently submitted our 2035 Nationally Determined
Contribution to the United Nations. We were one of only 20 countries out
of the 195 Parties to the Paris Agreement to have done so. We are committing
to reduce our emissions to between 45 and 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide
equivalent by 2035. This is actually a very small amount of global emissions,
accounting for 0.1% of global emissions, but we are committed to it. This
keeps us on a steady path towards our goal of net zero emissions by 2050,
and signals our resolve to work with businesses and our partners in the
region to transition to a low carbon future.</p>
<p>Asia, and Southeast Asia, have the potential, the capacity, and the impetus
to make this transition sooner rather than later. Let us move forward together,
with resolve, to shape a more sustainable future for our region, Asia,
and the world.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
