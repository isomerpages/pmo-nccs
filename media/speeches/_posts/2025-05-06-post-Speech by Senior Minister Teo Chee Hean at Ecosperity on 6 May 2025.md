<p><strong>Keynote Address by Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean at Ecosperity on 6 May 2025</strong>

<h4><strong>Asia’s Climate Battle: Mobilising Regional Action for a Sustainable Future</strong></h4>
<p>Mr Lim Boon Heng, Chairman of Temasek Holdings,
<br>Excellencies,
<br>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p></p>
<p>We meet at a time of deepening global uncertainty.</p>
<p>The international trading order has been upended. Supply chains are being
redrawn. Global leadership is in flux, giving rise to a more arbitrary,
protectionist, and dangerous world.</p>
<p>As a result, countries are reassessing their priorities, placing renewed
emphasis on economic resilience, self-sufficiency, and strategic autonomy.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, it is not surprising to hear calls for climate
ambition to be rolled back or at least deferred. Governments and businesses
are under pressure to focus on immediate concerns: preserving jobs, securing
supply chains, and deepening reserves in anticipation of potential shocks.</p>
<p>But we must be clear-minded. Those of you who run organisations know that
long-term success requires both a firm grasp on the demands of today, and
a steady eye on the needs of tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Asia: Epicentre of the climate battle </strong>
</p>
<p>The reality is that climate change will not wait for the world to find
its footing. Nature sets the pace, not us, and will not wait for countries
and business to act. The impact of climate change is increasingly apparent,
and Asia will be among the hardest hit.</p>
<p>If global temperatures continue to rise at the current rate, Asia’s economic
future will be in severe jeopardy if we do not do anything. The Asian Development
Bank estimates that Asia could see losses of up to 41% of GDP by 2100,
under a high emissions scenario.<sup>1</sup> Southeast Asia will be hit
particularly hard. By 2030, three quarters of Southeast Asian cities could
face regular flooding, potentially displacing tens of millions.<sup>2</sup> Heat
and extreme weather will disrupt food supplies, raise health issues, and
strain public systems. It is clear that our region will bear the full brunt
of climate impacts.</p>
