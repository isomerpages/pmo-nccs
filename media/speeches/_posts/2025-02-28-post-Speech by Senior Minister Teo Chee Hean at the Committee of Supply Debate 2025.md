<p><strong>Speech by Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean, Committee of Supply Debate 2025</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>From Commitment to Action: Staying the Course in the Low-Carbon Transition</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Chairman, Sir</p>
<p>I speak as Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change
(IMCCC). With your permission, I will take clarifications immediately after
this speech.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Need for Continued Climate Action</em></strong>
</p>
<p>It is a difficult time to talk about climate action.</p>
<p>The Paris Agreement in 2015 marked a breakthrough in global climate action,
with countries pledging to keep global warming within 1.5°C. Although there
has been unevenness in implementation, we were generally pulling in the
same direction as a global community.</p>
<p>However, the US has recently pulled out of the Paris Agreement – for the
second time. This has prompted other countries, like Argentina and Indonesia,
to question the wisdom of maintaining their climate commitments. Dr Lim
Wee Kiak asked how these global developments will affect Singapore’s climate
goals.</p>
<p>It is natural for countries to ask why they should continue to make these
difficult changes when others are not. And whether their efforts will even
result in any meaningful change, without the participation of bigger players.</p>
<p>Singapore’s Climate Ambassador Mr Ravi Menon gave a <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/opening-remarks-by-singapore-s-ambassador-for-climate-action-at-ecosperity-conversations/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">speech a week ago at Temasek's Ecosperity Conversations</a>,
which provides a succinct assessment of the global state of play on climate
change. I recommend that Members read it.</p>
<p>As Ambassador Menon points out, the main drivers of climate action are
politics, economics, and nature. I have touched on the political headwinds,
so let us examine the other two.</p>
<p>First, the economics. Green technology has advanced dramatically in the
last two decades. Several of these technologies are now mature and mainstream,
and make economic sense – they are not just cleaner but lower cost. The
average levelised cost of solar energy globally, for instance, is now 50%
lower than that of fossil fuels.<sup>1</sup> This explains why two-thirds
of global energy investment in 2024 went to clean energy technologies and
infrastructure.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>Countries and businesses realise this, which is why, despite political
perturbations, there is now much greater momentum for decarbonisation than
just a decade ago. Most of the world’s advanced economies have been investing
in decarbonisation and steadily reducing emissions. They recognise that
the green transition is an increasingly important driver of growth, and
therefore crucial not just to the health of the globe, but also to the
prosperity of their people.</p>
<p>This brings us to nature. Climate change is no longer a future threat;
it is already here. Every country, all of us, can see this – drought, fires,
floods, loss of crop yields, more severe storms. The last ten years have
been the hottest years ever on record.<sup>3 </sup> In short, the timeline
to respond and adapt is being set, not by us, but by Nature.</p>
<p>Countries and businesses which lag behind will be forced to act eventually.
The longer they wait, the sharper and more disruptive a transition they
will have to make.</p>
