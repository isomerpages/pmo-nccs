### SPEECH BY PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG AT OPENING OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CORPORATION’S INTEGRATED SOLAR MANUFACTURING COMPLEX, 3 NOVEMBER 2010

Ms Janne Julsrud  
Norway’s Ambassador to Singapore

Mr Ole Enger  
President and CEO, Renewable Energy Corporation

Distinguished guests

Ladies and Gentlemen

1.&nbsp;Congratulate Renewable Energy Corporation (REC) on grand opening of the integrated solar manufacturing facility

a)&nbsp;This is one of the largest ever investments in Singapore

b)&nbsp;REC has to date invested S$2.5 billion in Phase I of the project

c)&nbsp;When fully operational, plant and onsite suppliers will provide 1,700 high quality jobs

**Singapore’s Clean Energy Strategy**  
2.&nbsp;REC’s new complex is a key piece in Singapore’s Clean Energy strategy

a)&nbsp;We identified clean energy as a major growth area for our economy in 2007

b)&nbsp;Although there is not yet a global deal on climate change, many countries worldwide are studying various clean energy options

c)&nbsp;In fact efforts to tackle climate change will span decades

d)&nbsp;We can position ourselves for this long term development, contributing to global energy solutions while tapping the economic spinoffs

3.&nbsp;Singapore has developed a blueprint to grow the Clean Energy industry

a)&nbsp;Attract high-value, capital intensive investments in manufacturing

b)&nbsp;Develop the base of equipment companies and other suppliers

c)&nbsp;Build up strong R&D and support technological innovation  
i.&nbsp;We launched the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) in 2008  
ii.&nbsp;It has embarked on research projects with leading industry players including REC

d)&nbsp;Grow Singapore into the leading Asian Hub for system integration and project development

e)&nbsp;Government is committing $350 million to support efforts in this sector

4.&nbsp;Clean Energy blueprint follows a cluster strategy

a)&nbsp;Singapore has developed world-class industries by clustering companies with complementary strengths

b)&nbsp;We are applying this model to the clean energy sector

c)&nbsp;Our cluster strategy is no secret. In fact many others try to adopt it too

d)&nbsp;Hence critical for us to play to our strengths  
i.&nbsp;e.g. we are going into solar energy as it leverages on our existing strengths in electronics

**Investing in Our Workforce**  
5.&nbsp;But our most critical strength is the Singapore worker

a)&nbsp;Underpins our competitiveness

b)&nbsp;Major reason why many companies, particularly high-tech, knowledge-intensive companies, choose to locate in Singapore

c)&nbsp;In fact, REC told us the key reason they chose Singapore is our highly skilled and motivated workforce at all levels – managers, engineers, technicians and operators

d)&nbsp;Our workers have not disappointed  
i.&nbsp;Singapore facility was completed under budget and ramped up ahead of schedule, exceeding parent company’s expectations  
ii.&nbsp;Plant is now best-in-class among REC’s global operations  
iii.&nbsp;REC’s Peak Energy Module manufactured in Singapore was recently awarded the Solar Industry Award in Europe

e)&nbsp;Congratulate the entire REC team for their remarkable achievements within a short period of operations

6.&nbsp;We must work hard to maintain this advantage

a)&nbsp;Skills, innovation and productivity are our basis for sustaining economic growth  
b)&nbsp;Government is putting in billions of dollars into Continuing Education and Training  
c)&nbsp;Encourage workers to attend courses and upgrade their skills

7.&nbsp;We will continue to develop manpower for the Clean Energy industry  
a)&nbsp;Postgraduate scholarships to top universities

b)&nbsp;Clean Energy diploma courses in our polytechnics

c)&nbsp;Continuing Education and Training programmes conducted by the Workforce Development Agency (WDA)

d)&nbsp;In total, we will train over 2,000 specialists in the next 5 years through these initiatives

**Conclusion**  
8.&nbsp;REC’s opening today marks a milestone in the development of the clean energy sector in Singapore

a)&nbsp;Confident that sector will see strong growth

b)&nbsp;Singapore will work with clean energy companies to seize these opportunities

c)&nbsp;Wish REC success in this and future ventures
