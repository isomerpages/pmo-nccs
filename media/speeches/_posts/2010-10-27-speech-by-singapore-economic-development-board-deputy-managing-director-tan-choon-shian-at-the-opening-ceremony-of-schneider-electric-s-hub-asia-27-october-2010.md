Mr Emmanuel Babeau  
CFO, Schneider Electric

Distinguished Guests

Ladies and Gentlemen,

1\. Good Morning. It gives me great pleasure to join you today for the official opening of Hub Asia, a global distribution hub and supply chain control tower. This new facility is a significant milestone for Schneider Electric’s investments in Singapore.

**A Global Logistics and Supply-chain Hub Focused on Energy Efficiency**  
2\. Singapore is currently Schneider Electric’s regional HQ with engineering, R&D and logistics functions from the different global business units. It is also responsible for the management of the company’s manufacturing facility in Batam.

3\. Today we welcome the newest addition to Schneider Electric’s footprint in Singapore – a 14,000 square meter global distribution hub that will have in residence global logistics and supply chain functions and key decision makers. The hub will play a crucial role in helping Schneider Electric improve the turnaround time for distribution of its products and improve service levels for its customers.

4\. Hub Asia will have a focus not only in operational efficiency but also energy efficiency. Schneider Electric will be installing its own energy management systems, LED lighting technology and utilizing natural ventilation resulting in 30 per cent energy reduction as compared to the company’s former warehouse. Schneider also intends for Hub Asia to be a Green Mark certified building by the BCA. As an energy management company Schneider Electric certainly demonstrates a keen commitment to energy efficiency.


**Growing Importance of the Engineering Services Sector**  
5\. This is in line with Singapore’s commitment to environmental sustainability, in response to issues revolving around climate change and energy security.

6\. The ability of Singapore to play in the sustainable business arena depends on a strong engineering services sector, in which Schneider Electric belongs. Comprising engineering design & project management, as well as control & automation companies, this is an important sector that accounts for 1.2 per cent of GDP and employs about 35,000 people. It is projected to grow by 5 to 6 per cent annually from now till 2020.

7\. The engineering services sector is very talent-centric and that plays to Singapore’s strengths. Recognising the strength of the talent pool available in Singapore, leading multinational companies such as Schneider Electric have made Singapore an important based for their regional and global operations. The presence of these big players means that engineers in Singapore benefit from a broad range of opportunities and excellent career prospects.


**Conclusion**  
8\. On behalf of EDB, I would like to thank Schneider Electric for your belief in Singapore as an ideal home for your business. We will certainly continue to partner and support Schneider in its efforts to develop and excel in the engineering services industry.

9\. With this, I would once again like to congratulate Schneider Electric on the opening of Hub Asia and wish the management and staff every success in the years ahead.

Thank you.
