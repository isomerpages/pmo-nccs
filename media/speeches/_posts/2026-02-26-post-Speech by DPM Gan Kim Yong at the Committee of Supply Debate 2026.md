<p><strong>Speech by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong, Committee of Supply Debate 2026</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><em>Staying the Course in the Low-Carbon Transition</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, Sir,</p>
<p>Let me thank the Members for your interest in the subject of climate change,
which has long-term implications for Singapore’s competitiveness, our energy
security, and our resilience. With your permission, I will take clarifications
after this speech.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Reality of Climate Change</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Let me first begin with the fundamentals.</p>
<p>Whatever the political debates of the day, the physical reality of climate
change will continue its course. In fact, its effects are becoming more
pronounced, more frequent, and more costly.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Globally, last year was among the hottest on record, with rising ocean
temperatures and intensifying extreme weather events driving higher economic
losses worldwide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These impacts are especially acute in Southeast Asia, one of the world’s
most climate-vulnerable regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a highly open economy dependent on regional stability and global supply
chains, Singapore is directly exposed to these risks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, climate change is no longer a future risk. It is already affecting
lives and livelihoods here and now – and the costs of inaction will only
continue to rise.</p>
<p><strong><em>Climate Action Under Political Strain — But Not Driven by Politics Alone</em></strong>
</p>
<p>At the same time, we must acknowledge the reality on the ground, especially
on the political front.</p>
<p>Global climate action is under strain. Some countries have slowed down
the implementation of climate actions and started to review their climate
policies.</p>
<p>The recent decision by the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement
has introduced additional uncertainty into global climate cooperation.
At COP30, countries could not reach consensus on the phasing out of fossil
fuels. Some multinational companies have also scaled back their sustainability
commitments.</p>
<p>These developments do present cause for concern. But we must be clear
that while global progress has been uneven, it would be a mistake to conclude
that climate action is no longer relevant.</p>
<p>Some developed countries such as the UK and the EU members continue to
make sustained emissions cuts towards their 2030 Nationally Determined
Contribution targets or NDC targets.</p>
<p>Over 130 countries have set NDC targets for 2035. In total, these targets
cover around 80% of global emissions, including the US before it withdrew
from the Paris Agreement.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>China, the world’s largest emitter, has committed for the first time to
absolute emissions reductions beyond its peak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malaysia has done so too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>South Korea’s 2035 NDC target range is aligned to a linear pathway to
net zero, with room to improve.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Major economies are also continuing to make sustained investments in clean
energy and technology.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Clean energy now attracts around two-thirds of global energy investment.
In many countries, technologies such as solar and wind are already cheaper
than some fossil fuel alternatives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For many countries and companies, investing in clean technologies is increasingly
the rational choice – improving energy security, lowering long-term costs,
and creating growth and good jobs.</p>
<p>Overall, while the current global picture is mixed and political momentum
is uneven, economics, technology, and nature will eventually drive the
global transformation towards a low-carbon future.</p>
<p><strong><em>Singapore as a Climate Realist</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, Singapore approaches climate change as a climate
realist.</p>
<p>We begin with three hard realities.</p>
<p>First, climate change is real, worsening, and will shape the operating
environment for our economy and our society.</p>
<p>Second, Singapore contributes only 0.1% of global emissions. While what
we do alone cannot solve this global crisis, we must make our contributions
as a responsible member of the international community. This spurs others
to do likewise, and helps us secure our own long-term competitiveness and
resilience in a carbon-constrained world.</p>
<p>Third, Singapore is alternative-energy disadvantaged. Mature and easily
deployable decarbonisation options are simply not available to us.</p>
<p>Our transition will therefore be more challenging and will require more
lead time.</p>
<p>Therefore, Singapore needs to prepare early for a world that will become
increasingly carbon-constrained and climate-impaired. If we delay action,
the eventual adjustment will be sharper, more costly and more disruptive
for us.</p>
<p>At the same time, we must calibrate our climate actions carefully, taking
into consideration global developments, to manage near-term costs and competitiveness
for our households and our industries.</p>
<p><strong><em>Staying the Course</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Let me outline now our approach.</p>
<p><em>Carbon Tax</em>
</p>
<p>First, sending the right signal through carbon pricing. As we announced
earlier, we have increased the carbon tax to 45 dollars per tonne this
year.</p>
<p>As the world decarbonises, businesses and economies that are more emissions-intensive
will become less attractive to carbon-conscious investors and consumers.
Carbon pricing sends a clear, economy-wide signal that emissions carry
a cost, and that cleaner solutions have a value.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Ms Lee Hui Ying and Ms He Ting Ru asked about carbon tax and how
the carbon tax can encourage sustainable AI usage and adoption of renewable
energy respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carbon tax plays an important role through the right-pricing signal. Power
generation companies pass on their carbon tax burden to end users through
higher electricity prices. This increase, which is small for households
but more significant for energy-intensive companies, leads to two effects:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>First, this drives end-users such as data centre operators to be more
energy efficient, which helps to promote more sustainable adoption of AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, this narrows the difference in cost between cleaner energy alternatives
and fossil-fuel based options.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Carbon pricing is gaining traction globally.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Carbon pricing adoption continues to expand, driven in part by measures
such as the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which started
this year. The UK will introduce theirs next year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In our region, Thailand introduced a carbon tax last year, Malaysia plans
to do so this year, and Japan will make its national emissions trading
system mandatory this year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For Singapore, decarbonisation will be more costly than for many other
economies because of our resource constraints and lack of alternatives.
This means our carbon tax must be right-priced to spur companies to invest
in low-carbon technologies and reduce their emissions.</p>
<p>But pacing also matters. As Mr Mark Lee and Ms Lee Hui Ying have noted,
we must manage the near- to medium-term cost impact on our households and
businesses, relative to our regional competitors.</p>
<p>We are therefore reviewing the carbon tax trajectory for 2028 and beyond,
and will announce future rates in advance. If the global push for climate
action slows down significantly, we may need to position ourselves toward
the lower end of the previously announced range of 50 to 80 dollars per
tonne by 2030.</p>
<p>We will support our households and businesses through this transition.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It may be challenging for some companies in emissions-intensive and trade-exposed
sectors to decarbonise in the near term. This makes it difficult for them
to compete with firms operating in locations with low or no carbon tax.
We are engaging these affected companies to support their transition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will also support households to manage energy costs through additional
U-Save rebates as we have announced.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Domestic mitigation</em>
</p>
<p>Ms Poh Li San and Mr Azhar Othman asked about progress towards our climate
goals. We are making steady progress on various fronts.</p>
<p>For example, we have reached our 2030 solar deployment target of 2 gigawatt-peak
ahead of schedule, and will raise our 2030 target to 3 gigawatt-peak, as
announced by PM in the Budget speech earlier.</p>
<p>MTI will provide more details on clean energy during its COS.</p>
<p>We have also made good progress in the built environment and land transport.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We have greened 66% of our buildings as of last year, up from 61% the
year before. We are on track to reach 80% by 2030, reducing emissions while
helping businesses to save costs on energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are also progressing well towards our goal of having all vehicles run
on cleaner energy by 2040. Last year, 85% of newly registered cars were
cleaner energy models, up from 82% in 2024. EVs were the top-selling new
cars registered last year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every effort matters. Together, they form the backbone of our domestic
mitigation effort.</p>
<p><em>Leveraging cross-border solutions</em>
</p>
<p>Because our domestic options are limited, cross-border solutions are essential.</p>
<p>Carbon credits are one example.</p>
<p>Carbon credits allow us to decarbonise by financing emissions reductions
in overseas sites where there is greater potential for decarbonisation.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To date, we have signed 10 Implementation Agreements with countries such
as Vietnam, Thailand, and Peru.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have successfully operationalised four of these Agreements so far.
Building on this momentum, we will operationalise our fifth Agreement on
31 March with Thailand, with a call for projects under our partnership.
This marks our first operationalised Agreement with an ASEAN partner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are creating clear demand signals for carbon credits.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Last September, we announced the award for about 2 million tonnes of high-integrity,
nature-based credits from projects in Ghana, Paraguay, and Peru.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A second Request for Proposal for both technology and nature-based carbon
credits is currently in progress.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Exploring new pathways</em>
</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we are exploring novel solutions such as biomethane, low-carbon
hydrogen solutions and nuclear in the longer term.</p>
<p>Not all pathways will succeed. But we must continue to study our options
and create more options for Singapore.</p>
<p><em>Supporting businesses and workers through the transition</em>
</p>
<p>The climate transition will create new growth opportunities in areas such
as green manufacturing, carbon services and trading, and sustainable finance.
We will help our enterprises navigate this transition and thrive in this
future economy.</p>
<p>We have a suite of support schemes that businesses, particularly SMEs,
can tap on. This includes the Enterprise Sustainability Programme and the
Enterprise Development Grant.</p>
<p>In addition, we are supporting companies to build capabilities, including
in sustainability reporting through schemes such as the Sustainability
Reporting Grant, and this helps them remain integrated into global supply
chains.</p>
<p>As Mr Mark Lee noted, green procurement is another important enabler for
transition. Green procurement stimulates demand and revenue for companies
which can operate more sustainably and offer lower-carbon products. Since
last year, the Government has set aside up to&nbsp;5% of tender evaluation
criteria for environmental sustainability considerations for large construction
and ICT hardware tenders. This provides opportunities for our businesses
to build a track record to meet the demands of other buyers and investors
who are seeking green goods and services. For example, large companies
with significant purchasing power such as Siemens and Schneider Electric
have their own green procurement frameworks globally. We will continue
to support greener procurement choices in a manner that takes into account
&nbsp;industry readiness and international developments.</p>
<p>Most importantly, as Mr Ng Shi Xuan and Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin have said,
we will support our workers to capture opportunities in this green transition.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For example, we are implementing new training programmes in sustainability
reporting and in the Energy sector, two priority areas identified by the
Green Skills Committee.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To pull together the many strands of work, the Singapore Business Federation
has recommended establishing a public-private Carbon Transition Council,
to support companies in transition planning and seize green opportunities.
We are assessing the proposal and will provide an update in due course.</p>
<p><strong><em>Exercising Influence Beyond Our Size</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Climate change cannot be solved by any single country. It requires collective
action. And even as we press on domestically, we are working with international
partners to push ahead with global climate action.</p>
<p>Singapore contributes by catalysing flows of finance and shaping credible
frameworks.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>At COP28, we launched the Financing Asia’s Transition Partnership (FAST-P)
to bring together public, private, and philanthropic partners to finance
Asia’s green transition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore has pledged up to US$500 million to FAST-P, with the aim of
crowding in up to US$5 billion of commercial capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Green Investments Partnership under FAST-P has achieved its first
close with US$510 million in committed capital – 10 times the Government’s
initial contribution of US$50 million. This will be deployed to support
green and sustainable infrastructure projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also doing our part to support the development&nbsp; of high-integrity
carbon markets, and rolling out novel types of carbon credits such as energy
transition credits to support early coal phase-out in the region.</p>
<p>These efforts reduce regional climate risks, strengthen economic resilience,
and reinforce Singapore’s role as a trusted and credible partner.</p>
<p><strong><em>Adapting to a Climate-Impaired Future</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Finally, mitigation alone is not enough.</p>
<p>Even under optimistic scenarios, the world will face increasingly severe
climate impacts. We must undertake adaptation as a core pillar of our long-term
climate resilience.</p>
<p>We are developing a National Adaptation Plan to strengthen resilience
across infrastructure, public health, water, food, and coastal protection.
We are ramping up targeted measures, particularly to address heat stress.
MSE will elaborate on this.</p>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Chairman, the road ahead will be bumpy.</p>
<p>Global climate action will remain uneven. Technologies will mature at
uncertain pace. The cost impact will need to be managed carefully.</p>
<p>But the direction towards a low-carbon future is clear – and we are heartened
that the world has made meaningful progress.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The annual increase in global carbon emissions is now at 0.3% – one fifth
that in the decade before the Paris Agreement was signed – although this
is still not enough to keep global warming below one and a half degrees
Celsius.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Singapore’s task is not to posture, but to prepare and to act. We are
a climate realist.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;We will watch developments in global climate action and key technologies
that will inform the pace at which we ought to move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And we will do what we must, to secure our survival and prosperity in
the low-carbon and climate-impaired world of the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By decarbonising steadily and adapting decisively, we will ensure that
Singapore remains competitive, liveable and resilient for many decades
ahead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
