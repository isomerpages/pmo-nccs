<p>Speech by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan
Kim Yong, Committee of Supply Debate 2026</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Staying the Course in the Low-Carbon Transition</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, Sir,</p>
<p>1. Let me thank the Members for your interest in the subject of climate
change, which has long-term implications for Singapore’s competitiveness,
our energy security, and our resilience. With your permission, I will take
clarifications after this speech.</p>
<p>The Reality of Climate Change</p>
<p>2. Let me first begin with the fundamentals.</p>
<p>3. Whatever the political debates of the day, the physical reality of
climate change will continue its course. In fact, its effects are becoming
more pronounced, more frequent, and more costly.</p>
<p>a. Globally, last year was among the hottest on record, with rising ocean
temperatures and intensifying extreme weather events driving higher economic
losses worldwide.</p>
<p>b. These impacts are especially acute in Southeast Asia, one of the world’s
most climate-vulnerable regions.</p>
<p>c. As a highly open economy dependent on regional stability and global
supply chains, Singapore is directly exposed to these risks.</p>
<p>4. In short, climate change is no longer a future risk. It is already
affecting lives and livelihoods here and now – and the costs of inaction
will only continue to rise.</p>
<p>Climate Action Under Political Strain — But Not Driven by Politics Alone</p>
<p>5. At the same time, we must acknowledge the reality on the ground, especially
on the political front.</p>
<p>6. Global climate action is under strain. Some countries have slowed down
the implementation of climate actions and started to review their climate
policies.</p>
<p>7. The recent decision by the United States to withdraw from the Paris
Agreement has introduced additional uncertainty into global climate cooperation.
At COP30, countries could not reach consensus on the phasing out of fossil
fuels. Some multinational companies have also scaled back their sustainability
commitments.</p>
<p>8. These developments do present cause for concern. But we must be clear
that while global progress has been uneven, it would be a mistake to conclude
that climate action is no longer relevant.</p>
<p>9. Some developed countries such as the UK and the EU members continue
to make sustained emissions cuts towards their 2030 Nationally Determined
Contribution targets or NDC targets.</p>
<p>10. Over 130 countries have set NDC targets for 2035. In total, these
targets cover around 80% of global emissions, including the US before it
withdrew from the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>a. China, the world’s largest emitter, has committed for the first time
to absolute emissions reductions beyond its peak.</p>
<p>b. Malaysia has done so too.</p>
<p>c. South Korea’s 2035 NDC target range is aligned to a linear pathway
to net zero, with room to improve.</p>
<p>11. Major economies are also continuing to make sustained investments
in clean energy and technology.</p>
<p>a. Clean energy now attracts around two-thirds of global energy investment.
In many countries, technologies such as solar and wind are already cheaper
than some fossil fuel alternatives.</p>
<p>12. For many countries and companies, investing in clean technologies
is increasingly the rational choice – improving energy security, lowering
long-term costs, and creating growth and good jobs.</p>
<p>13. Overall, while the current global picture is mixed and political momentum
is uneven, economics, technology, and nature will eventually drive the
global transformation towards a low-carbon future.</p>
<p>Singapore as a Climate Realist</p>
<p>14. Against this backdrop, Singapore approaches climate change as a climate
realist.</p>
<p>15. We begin with three hard realities.</p>
<p>16. First, climate change is real, worsening, and will shape the operating
environment for our economy and our society.</p>
<p>17. Second, Singapore contributes only 0.1% of global emissions. While
what we do alone cannot solve this global crisis, we must make our contributions
as a responsible member of the international community. This spurs others
to do likewise, and helps us secure our own long-term competitiveness and
resilience in a carbon-constrained world.</p>
<p>18. Third, Singapore is alternative-energy disadvantaged. Mature and easily
deployable decarbonisation options are simply not available to us.</p>
<p>19. Our transition will therefore be more challenging and will require
more lead time.</p>
<p>20. Therefore, Singapore needs to prepare early for a world that will
become increasingly carbon-constrained and climate-impaired. If we delay
action, the eventual adjustment will be sharper, more costly and more disruptive
for us.</p>
<p>21. At the same time, we must calibrate our climate actions carefully,
taking into consideration global developments, to manage near-term costs
and competitiveness for our households and our industries.</p>
<p>Staying the Course</p>
<p>22. Let me outline now our approach.</p>
<p>Carbon Tax</p>
<p>23. First, sending the right signal through carbon pricing. As we announced
earlier, we have increased the carbon tax to 45 dollars per tonne this
year.</p>
<p>24. As the world decarbonises, businesses and economies that are more
emissions-intensive will become less attractive to carbon-conscious investors
and consumers. Carbon pricing sends a clear, economy-wide signal that emissions
carry a cost, and that cleaner solutions have a value.</p>
<p>a. Ms Lee Hui Ying and Ms He Ting Ru asked about carbon tax and how the
carbon tax can encourage sustainable AI usage and adoption of renewable
energy respectively.</p>
<p>b. Carbon tax plays an important role through the right-pricing signal.
Power generation companies pass on their carbon tax burden to end users
through higher electricity prices. This increase, which is small for households
but more significant for energy-intensive companies, leads to two effects:</p>
<p>i. First, this drives end-users such as data centre operators to be more
energy efficient, which helps to promote more sustainable adoption of AI.</p>
<p>ii. Second, this narrows the difference in cost between cleaner energy
alternatives and fossil-fuel based options.</p>
<p>25. Carbon pricing is gaining traction globally.</p>
<p>a. Carbon pricing adoption continues to expand, driven in part by measures
such as the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which started
this year. The UK will introduce theirs next year.</p>
<p>b. In our region, Thailand introduced a carbon tax last year, Malaysia
plans to do so this year, and Japan will</p>
<p>make its national emissions trading system mandatory this year.</p>
