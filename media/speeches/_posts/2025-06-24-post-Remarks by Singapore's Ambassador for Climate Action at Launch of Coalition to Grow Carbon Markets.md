<p><strong>REMARKS BY SINGAPORE'S AMBASSADOR FOR CLIMATE ACTION AT LAUNCH OF COALITION TO GROW CARBON MARKETS, LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE, UNITED KINGDOM, 24 JUNE 2025</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>A Government Coalition to Grow Carbon Markets</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We are about 1.5 trillion US dollars short of what is required each year
to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carbon markets are a powerful lever to help narrow this funding gap at
the pace and scale needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When businesses buy carbon credits to meet their climate targets, they
are helping to enable decarbonisation elsewhere that would otherwise not
have taken place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But the carbon markets are facing a crisis of confidence.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>On the supply side, we have seen instances of poor environmental integrity,
where the carbon abatement is not real or additional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the demand side, there is uncertainty on the part of businesses.&nbsp;
There is no consensus on when businesses can use carbon credits to meet
their climate targets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not reasons to walk away from carbon markets.&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Rather, they are reasons to work towards better, stronger, and more transparent
markets. It is not the tool that is at fault but the manner in which it
has been used.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are demand, supply, and market infrastructure issues that we need
to address.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why Kenya, Singapore, and the United Kingdom have come together
to establish a government-led coalition to grow the carbon markets.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We have been reaching out to several countries in the last few weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>France and Panama have already committed to join the Coalition. Several
others have expressed support and are considering joining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By COP30, we expect to have a good-sized Coalition, comprising countries
which are sources of high-integrity carbon credits as well as countries
which are sources of demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Coalition will collaborate with industry, standard setters, and international
organisations, to ensure our work is relevant and credible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will establish by COP30 a set of shared principles on the corporate
use of carbon credits.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We are not doing this in isolation but rather in response to industry
feedback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses are telling us they need sovereign voices to provide them the
confidence to use carbon credits while maximising their decarbonisation
efforts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The intent of the shared principles is to ensure consistency but not uniformity.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Individual countries may choose to issue more detailed guidance to suit
their national circumstances but taking care to ensure alignment internationally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The United Kingdom has issued draft guidance for its companies on the
voluntary use of carbon credits. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just last week, Singapore published its own draft guidance for public
consultation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We look forward to more countries stepping up to provide guidance to their
businesses on the responsible use of carbon credits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And lest we forget, this is not just about providing clarity for businesses.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>It is also about creating sustainable development benefits and opportunities
for countries that are sources of carbon credits, especially in the Global
South.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also about creating a vibrant carbon services industry, providing
new sources of growth and jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of all, it is about helping to unlock the financing necessary to
reduce carbon emissions and safeguard our planet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Carbon markets can be a powerful force for good.&nbsp; We want to work
with you to make them so.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
