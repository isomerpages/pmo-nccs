<p><strong>NATIONAL STATEMENT OF SINGAPORE DELIVERED BY MS GRACE FU, MINISTER FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND THE ENVIRONEMNT, AT THE UNFCCC COP30 HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT ON 17 NOVEMBER 2025 BELÉM, BRAZIL</strong>
</p>
<hr>
<p>Mr President,</p>
<p>Congratulations on your election as President of this Conference. I thank
the Brazil Government, the City of Belem, and the UNFCCC Secretariat for
organising COP30 this year. I also thank your team, Mr President, and the
Brazilian Presidency, for your leadership in advancing discussions, and
placing the focus of COP30 on the implementation of our global climate
agenda.</p>
<p>Climate change continues to outpace the collective response of the global
community. 2024 was the warmest year on record, and the first year to be
more than 1.5°C above the pre-industrial era. Ocean temperatures have soared
to historic heights, and the biggest and most intense coral bleaching episode
ever witnessed has spread to more than 80% of the world’s reefs, leading
scientists to conclude that the world’s tropical coral reefs have almost
certainly crossed a point of no return. This means that Earth has likely
reached its first so-called “tipping point”. Storms, floods, heatwaves,
and droughts are also becoming more frequent and more intense.</p>
<p>Overlaying this is a backdrop of intensifying geopolitical tensions and
economic uncertainty. Multilateral cooperation is being put to the test,
and the Brazilian Presidency has responded&nbsp; with a call to collective
action – the Global Mutirão. This call captures the spirit we need: many
actors, working together, focused on real outcomes. Today, Singapore reaffirms
our commitment to working with the global community to make collective
progress towards our shared climate goals.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation Efforts</strong>
</p>
<p>As a small low-lying island state, climate change is an existential challenge
for Singapore. This is why we were one of thirteen countries who submitted
our 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) by the 10 February 2025
deadline. Our 2035 NDC pledged to reduce our emissions to between 45 to
50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2035.&nbsp; The 45 million
tonnes target puts us on a linear trajectory to net zero in 2050.</p>
<p>Our 2035 NDC reflects our commitment to climate action. Given our circumstance
as an alternative-energy disadvantaged island state, our ability to meet
these goals depends on the maturity of mitigation technologies, and effective
international collaboration.</p>
<p>Despite our limited land area, we have been pushing hard on solar, which
remains our most viable domestic source of renewable energy. We have deployed
more than 1.7 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar to date, quadrupling our solar
deployment from 2020. We are on track to meet our target of at least 2GWp
of solar deployment by 2030.</p>
<p>To further diversify our low-carbon energy mix, we are establishing a
regulatory sandbox to explore biomethane as a low-carbon fuel. In September
2025, the Singapore Economic Development Board issued a closed call for
proposals to demonstrate biomethane’s potential for power generation and
industrial applications.&nbsp; We are also exploring the potential deployment
of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>Singapore is also actively looking to import low-carbon electricity from
our region. Last month, Singapore granted conditional approval to import
1GW of low-carbon electricity generated from hydropower from Sarawak, Malaysia.
This brings us to about 8GW of potential cross-border electricity trading
projects from our region, including from Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia and
Australia.</p>
<p>Beyond power imports, Singapore is advancing the use of low-carbon fuels
in the maritime and aviation – sectors central to our role as a global
hub. Singapore is exploring methanol and ammonia as low-carbon fuels for
the maritime sector. Our Energy Market Authority and Maritime and Port
Authority (MPA) appointed a consortium led by Keppel Ltd to work on an
end-to-end low-carbon ammonia solution on Jurong Island. If successful,
Singapore will be one of the first countries in the world to directly combust
ammonia for power generation and deploy ammonia bunkering for international
shipping.</p>
<p>The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has set up a new entity
to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel and secure a more affordable,
stable supply for Singapore and the region. From 1 Jan 2026, flights departing
from Singapore will be required to use at least 1% of sustainable aviation
fuel.&nbsp; Last month, CAAS announced that the Singapore Sustainable Aviation
Fuel Company (SAFCo) has been formed to support the implementation of Singapore’s
national sustainable aviation fuel policy.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptation and Resilience Efforts</strong>
</p>
<p>While we continue to advance mitigation and decarbonisation, Singapore
is equally focused on stepping up our adaptation and resilience efforts.
Over the next five years, we will develop Singapore’s inaugural National
Adaptation Plan to address the physical risks and other impacts of climate
change.</p>
<p><em>Coastal Resilience</em>
</p>
<p>30% of Singapore’s land is less than 5m above mean sea level. We are vulnerable
to the impact of sea level rise, and have made plans to implement various
coastal protection measures progressively over the coming decades. Our
national water agency, PUB, completed the first coastal protection site
study for the eastern coast of the City. The recommendations from the study,
together with the reclamation of ‘Long Island’ – an offshore new island
entirely reclaimed from the sea&nbsp;that will protect the entire East
Coast area – will form a continuous line of defence to protect City-East
Coast against rising sea levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Government will also introduce a Coastal Protection Bill&nbsp;next
year, to spell out the responsibilities of stakeholders involved in Coastal
Protection, and to provide powers for enforcement and compliance with coastal
protection standards.&nbsp;PUB will also launch a code of practice for
coastal protection by the first half of 2026 to set standards for the design,
construction and operation of coastal protection structures in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Heat Resilience</em>
</p>
<p>Singapore’s Third National Climate Change Study projects that in the worst
case scenario, by the end of this century annual average temperatures in
Singapore could rise by up to 5°C, with a sharp increase in days experiencing
high heat stress. As such, we are taking proactive steps to strengthen
our resilience to heat.</p>
<p>Last year, the Government implemented a revised framework to protect outdoor
workers from heat stress, aligning workplace safety measures with the three-tier
national Heat Stress Advisory. This framework requires practical safeguards
such as regular hydration, rest breaks in shaded areas, and heat acclimatisation,
with enforcement through workplace inspections.</p>
<p>This year, Singapore launched a National Heatwave Response Plan, which
sets out a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to manage extreme
heat events and protect residents, particularly vulnerable groups. While
Singapore has not yet experienced heatwaves of the intensity seen in other
parts of the world, we are preparing early to manage these risks. Measures
like these will ensure that Singapore remains ready to manage the impacts
of a warming climate while safeguarding health and livelihoods.</p>
<p><strong>Regional Cooperation</strong>
</p>
<p>While we continue to push the limits of our domestic efforts, we recognise
that our climate goals cannot be achieved in isolation. Southeast Asia
is warming faster than the global average, with coastal cities and delta
communities facing increasing flood and heat risks. Building regional resilience
is therefore critical.</p>
<p>To this end, Singapore is working closely with our neighbours to deepen
regional climate science and improve adaptation planning. Researchers from
the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Tropical Marine Science Institute
are working with other ASEAN countries to study the impact of climate change
on the region’s agriculture sector. The study will analyse data on the
projected physical impacts of climate change on five agriculture crops:
maize, rice, cassava, sugar cane and soya bean, and propose mitigating
measures that ASEAN nations can take to address the impact of climate change
on the five crops.</p>
<p>In January this year, The Heat Resilience &amp; Performance Centre at
the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore&nbsp;was
officially designated as the Global Heat Health Information Network&nbsp;Southeast
Asia Hub, a recognition that underscores its leading role in advancing
heat resilience. This designation highlights the Centre’s expertise in
addressing the growing challenges of heat-related health risks in the region.
With this appointment, the Centre will play a pivotal role in working with
the region to shape strategies, research, and policies aimed at mitigating
the impact of extreme heat on public health, demonstrating its commitment
to building resilience in the face of climate change.</p>
<p>Singapore is also working closely with our partners to realise the ASEAN
Power Grid (APG). By interconnecting national grids, the APG will enable
low-carbon electricity to flow across borders, balance supply and demand,
improve energy security, and advance a shared pathway toward net zero for
Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Last month, ASEAN Energy Ministers endorsed the ASEAN Submarine Power
Cables Development Framework Terms of Reference (TOR). When finalised,
the framework will support the conduct of subsea route surveys as well
as the laying, maintenance, and protection of submarine power cables in
Southeast Asia, all of which are crucial to realise the APG. We also welcome
initiatives, such as the APG Financing Initiative co-developed by the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank, to lower financing hurdles and enhance
the bankability of cross-border electricity trading projects in the region.</p>
<p>To complement these efforts, the International Energy Agency (IEA) Regional
Cooperation Centre in Singapore, which celebrated its first anniversary
this October, was established to deepen the IEA’s engagement in the region.
Within its first year, the Centre has published numerous reports on clean
energy technologies and strengthened its regional partnerships to advance
energy transitions. Singapore and the IEA also co-hosted the 9th edition
of the Singapore–IEA Regional Training Programme, which brought together
more than 200 policymakers and industry leaders from the region to deepen
exchanges on cross-border power trading and subsea interconnections.</p>
<p>Singapore has also been engaging our regional partners on technologies
that will enable deep decarbonisation. One example is our efforts on Carbon
Capture and Storage (CCS). Earlier this year, Singapore signed MoUs with
Malaysia and Indonesia on CCS. We are now working towards legally binding
bilateral agreements to enable the cross-border transport and storage of
carbon dioxide between our countries. Advancing the safe, scalable deployment
of CCS solutions will serve as a key pathway for Singapore's hard-to-abate
sectors.</p>
<p>Additionally, this year, CAAS launched the Asia-Pacific Sustainable Aviation
Centre,&nbsp;to&nbsp;conduct sustainable aviation in the Asia-Pacific region
in a pragmatic way that would achieve both development and sustainability
goals. It will do so through policy research&nbsp;in areas such as cleaner
aviation fuels, carbon accounting, and carbon market development, as well
as facilitate collaboration&nbsp;across governments, industry and academia
for joint studies and projects to advance sustainable aviation policies
and plans for the Asia-Pacific region. The Centre will also support regional
capability-building through technical assistance and training in areas
of sustainable aviation policy development and implementation.</p>
<p><strong>International Contributions</strong>
</p>
<p>These regional partnerships demonstrate what multilateral collaboration
can achieve. To bring them to scale and deliver real impact, Singapore
places great emphasis on the next enabler of implementation – finance.
The Baku-to-Belem Roadmap to 1.3 trillion recognises the urgent need to
close the global climate finance gap. However, current finance flows fall
far short of what is required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>As a trusted global financial hub, Singapore is doing its part voluntarily
to help fill this gap.&nbsp; Our contributions focus on three pillars:
capacity building, mobilising blended finance, and strengthening carbon
markets.</p>
<p><em>Capacity Building</em>
</p>
<p>Strengthening institutional and technical capabilities is essential to
achieving&nbsp;our global climate goals. That is why Singapore supports
efforts to build institutional and technical capabilities, including through
our contribution to the UNFCCC non-core budget to be earmarked towards
the UNFCCC’s proposal for “Supporting Developing Countries in Implementing
the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF)”.&nbsp; By strengthening the
implementation of the ETF across countries, we help to ensure accountability
as developing countries strive to deliver positive climate outcomes. Only
when all countries have the systems and capacity to act can global climate
finance deliver, and keep the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach.</p>
<p><em>Blended Finance</em>
</p>
<p>Two years ago, at COP28, Singapore Government announced Financing Asia’s
Transition Partnership (FAST-P). FAST-P is a blended finance initiative
which brings together international public, private and philanthropic partners
to support Asia’s green and transition financing needs, and aims to raise
US$5 billion. Last year, at COP29, the Singapore Government pledged up
to US$500 million concessional capital to match dollar-for-dollar, concessional
capital from other partners.</p>
<p>This year, Singapore has made further progress with FAST-P. The Green
Investments Partnership has achieved its first closure of projects&nbsp;with
US$510 million of committed capital. The capital will be deployed to support
green and sustainable infrastructure projects in Southeast and South Asia
across a strong pipeline of transactions. The pipeline of projects includes
renewable energy and storage, electric vehicles, and water and waste management.</p>
<p><em>Carbon Markets</em>
</p>
<p>Another way in which Singapore aims to direct financing towards climate
action is through carbon markets. Carbon markets are a potentially transformational
pathway to mobilise private capital to unlock additional emissions reductions
while simultaneously funding host countries’ economic development and decarbonisation
efforts, as well as unlocking other sustainable development benefits. Singapore
takes an ecosystem approach to carbon markets. We are working to boost
demand-side confidence, unlock high-integrity supply, and develop the enablers
for a high-quality carbon market.</p>
<p>To bolster demand, Singapore is exploring the development of energy transition
credits as a novel carbon credit type and financing instrument for the
phasing out of coal as a fuel source in Asia. These credits are generated
from the emissions reductions attributed to the early retirement of coal
plants and their replacement with cleaner energy sources. At COP 28, we
convened the Transition Credits Coalition, or TRACTION, comprising over
30 global ecosystem players to identify system-wide barriers and solutions
for energy transition credits to be utilised as a credible financing instrument
to support the managed and equitable early retirement of coal plants. TRACTION
has just released its final report at COP30, outlining practical solutions
and identifying key areas for further action to help the industry operationalise
and scale the use of energy transition credits.</p>
<p>In parallel, Singapore continues to prioritise nature-based solutions
as a vital mitigation and finance pathway. In September this year, we committed
to procuring 2.175 million tonnes of Article 6-aligned nature-based carbon
credits from four projects in Ghana, Paraguay and Peru at an approximate
value of S$76 million or US$58 million. These projects aim to reduce carbon
emissions from deforestation, increase carbon sequestration of soil organic
carbon stock in grasslands through sustainable management practices, and
remove carbon emissions through the reforestation of degraded pastureland.</p>
<p>A well-functioning global carbon market requires more than just compliance
credits. Therefore, Singapore is also working to strengthen demand in the
Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM). In June this year, the Governments of Kenya,
Singapore, and the United Kingdom announced the creation of The Coalition
to Grow Carbon Markets, a government-led initiative to strengthen voluntary
demand for carbon credits. The Coalition comprises ten governments committed
to advancing climate action through making clear how businesses can credibly
use high-integrity carbon credits in addition to their corporate decarbonisation
plans.<sup>1</sup> Earlier this month, in São Paulo, the Coalition launched
a set of Shared Principles on the voluntary use of high-integrity carbon
credits by corporates, responding to calls from businesses for more cohesion
and transparency, and stronger, clearer incentives to engage with carbon
markets. The Shared Principles will give businesses the confidence they
need to invest in carbon markets to support projects relating to sustainable
agriculture, clean energy, as well as nature conservation and restoration.</p>
<p>At Singapore International Energy Week in October this year, we also published
a VCM guidance to guide Singapore-based companies in their usage of carbon
credits as part of a credible decarbonisation plan. This set of guidelines
for Singapore-based companies go hand in hand with the Shared Principles.
To demonstrate application of the key principles outlined within the VCM
guidance, our government agency EnterpriseSG is in discussions with leading
corporates in Asia to establish an industry-led buyers’ coalition to align
and channel demand towards high-integrity carbon credits in the region
and beyond.</p>
<p>To unlock high-integrity supply, Singapore has made international cooperation
on Article 6 carbon credits a key focal point. This year, we signed Implementation
Agreements (IAs) with eight additional countries – namely, Bhutan, Peru,
Chile, Rwanda, Paraguay, Thailand, Vietnam and Mongolia. This brings the
total number of IAs Singapore has signed to 10. We continue to work with
the host countries to operationalise the IAs, with our latest call for
applications being for the Singapore-Peru IA.&nbsp;&nbsp; We look forward
to deepening collaboration with these partner countries to mobilise investment
in high-quality, high-integrity carbon projects.</p>
<p>In addition to growing demand and supply, Singapore invests in enablers
that will underpin a well-functioning carbon market. We are growing a carbon
services and trading ecosystem to service and support global carbon markets.
To-date, over 150 carbon services and trading firms have established a
presence in Singapore. Most recently, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary
Carbon Market (ICVCM) expanded its global presence through the launch of
its Asia Pacific Hub in Singapore, signalling confidence in our growing
position as a trusted carbon services hub. As a global meta standard, ICVCM
plays a vital role in strengthening integrity in carbon credits through
their Core Carbon Principles, and helping scale the supply of high-quality
carbon credits globally.</p>
<p>To strengthen the capacity of financial institutions to play a key enabling
role in the carbon market value chain the Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) has introduced a Financial Sector Carbon Market Development Grant,
amounting to S$15 million or US$11.5 million over three years till 2028.
This will help support financial institutions to build capabilities for
carbon-project financing, trading, insurance and related services; and
help defray upfront costs associated with transaction structuring, financing,
risk management, and trading of carbon credits.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>To conclude, Singapore reaffirms our full support for the COP30 Presidency
and the UNFCCC. A decade has passed since the global community adopted
the Paris Agreement in 2015. Its vision remains as relevant as ever, but
its promises can only be kept if we commit to collaborate and make collective
progress towards our climate goals. As an ‘Implementation COP’, COP 30
must enable Parties to turn their commitments into concrete results. Singapore
stands ready to work with all Parties to ensure that our collective efforts
keep global climate targets within reach.&nbsp;</p>
