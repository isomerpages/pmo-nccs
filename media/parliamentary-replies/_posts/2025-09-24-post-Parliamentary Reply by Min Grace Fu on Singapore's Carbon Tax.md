<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
<br><strong>WRITTEN ANSWER</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ms Lee Hui Ying:</strong> To ask the Minister for Sustainability
and the Environment (a) whether an update can be provided on the intended
carbon tax rate beyond 2027; and (b) whether Singapore is on track to meet
the target of $50 to $80 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)
by 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Ms Poh Li San: </strong>To ask the Minister for Sustainability
and the Environment (a) how will the increase in carbon tax planned for
the next few years impact the emissions produced in Singapore; (b) what
will be the impact on household utilities costs; and (c) in view of rising
business costs, whether the Carbon Tax increase planned for 2028 will be
pushed back or reduced.</p>
<p><strong>Reply by Minister:</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2022, we announced that the Government planned to progressively increase
the carbon tax to $45 per tonne in 2026 and 2027, with a view to reaching
$50 to $80 per tonne by 2030.</p>
<p>The Government reviews the trajectory of our carbon tax rate from time
to time taking into account prevailing circumstances and will provide updates
in due course.</p>
