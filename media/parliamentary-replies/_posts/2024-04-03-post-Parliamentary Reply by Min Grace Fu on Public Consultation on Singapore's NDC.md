<p><strong>FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE<br>WRITTEN ANSWER</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms He Ting Ru:</strong> To ask the Minister for Sustainability
and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry intends to conduct a public
consultation on Singapore’s new or updated Nationally Determined Contribution
(NDC) which outlines Singapore’s efforts in reducing its greenhouse gas
emissions, that will be due under the Paris Agreement in 2025; and (b)
whether this will be done in time for the submission of the updated NDC
at least 9 to 12 months in advance of the relevant Conference of Parties.</p>
<p><strong>Reply by Minister:</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore is committed to fulfilling our international obligations under
the Paris Agreement to contribute to global climate action.</p>
<p>After submitting our initial 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution,
or NDC, in 2019, we recently raised our climate ambition to achieve net
zero emissions by 2050 in October 2022. We also pledged to reduce emissions
to around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030 after
peaking emissions earlier. Agencies are working towards these targets.</p>
<p>The Government is concurrently developing Singapore’s 2035 NDC, including
plans to consult stakeholders.</p>
