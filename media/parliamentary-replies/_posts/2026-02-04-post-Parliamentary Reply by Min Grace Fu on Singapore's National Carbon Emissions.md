<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
<br><strong>WRITTEN ANSWER</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ms Poh Li San:</strong> To ask the Prime Minister and Minister
for Finance in view of the reduction of national carbon emissions to 55.5
million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2023, whether the Government
will step up structural reforms that lead to emissions reductions in the
manufacturing, power, waste and water sectors, which account for 70% of
total national emissions, to continue this downward trend.</p>
<p><strong>Reply by Minister:</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore’s national carbon emissions in 2023 was 55.5 million tonnes
(Mt), a 5.3 per cent reduction from 2022’s 58.59Mt. This was primarily
due to reduced output in the petrochemical sector, driven by a global downcycle
in the sector. Consumption of petrol and diesel in the domestic transport
sector also continued to fall, reflecting progress towards achieving our
target of 100 per cent cleaner energy vehicles by 2040.</p>
<p>Singapore is committed to global climate action, and positioning ourselves
for success in a low carbon future. We are progressively implementing our
decarbonisation plans across all sectors of the economy to meet our 2030
Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), as well as our 2035 NDC which
we submitted to the UNFCCC in February last year. For example, we are working
closely with companies to help them improve their energy efficiency and
lower the carbon intensity of their products and services, through schemes
like the Enhanced Resource Efficiency Grant for Emissions.</p>
<p>For a country like Singapore, our lack of resources requires us to depend
heavily on global technological advancements and effective international
cooperation to decarbonise. We are closely monitoring global developments,
particularly on technology, renewable energy and carbon markets, to decarbonise
in the most cost-effective way possible.</p>
