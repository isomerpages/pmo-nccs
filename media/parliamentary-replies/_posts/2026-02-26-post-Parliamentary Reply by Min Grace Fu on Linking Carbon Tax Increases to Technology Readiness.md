<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
<br><strong>WRITTEN ANSWER</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng: </strong>To ask the Minister for Sustainability
and the Environment given global adjustments to carbon pricing, (a) why
has the Ministry maintained the planned trajectory of $50 to $80 per tonne
by 2030 instead of linking increases explicitly to technology readiness
or regional carbon price alignment; and (b) what specific indicators will
justify moderating the pace of increase in carbon tax to safeguard jobs
while sustaining climate ambition.</p>
<p><strong>Reply by Minister:</strong>
</p>
<p>Tackling the complex challenge of climate change requires long-term planning
and staying the course on a clear set of directions. As the world transits
towards a low-carbon future, businesses and economies that remain emissions-intensive
relative to their competitors will become less attractive. Singapore is
alternative energy disadvantaged; our decarbonisation solutions are therefore
more expensive and require longer lead times to study and implement. Consequently,
our carbon tax rates need to reflect Singapore’s higher costs of decarbonisation,
to provide an economy-wide price signal to improve energy- and carbon-efficiency
in all sectors,&nbsp;and to enhance the business case for investing in
low-carbon solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government provides advance notice of the carbon tax trajectory to
enable businesses to act early and adapt their operations. At Budget 2022,
we announced a target carbon price of $50 to $80 per tonne by 2030. Nonetheless,
we remain alert to the evolving near-term cost impact, especially on businesses.
We will continually assess Singapore’s post-2027 carbon tax trajectory
carefully, in the light of international developments.</p>
<p>We will continue to calibrate our carbon tax trajectory to strike a balance
between spurring decarbonisation to secure Singapore’s longer-term resilience
and competitiveness in a low-carbon future, and managing the nearer-term&nbsp;cost&nbsp;impact
on our businesses and households.</p>
