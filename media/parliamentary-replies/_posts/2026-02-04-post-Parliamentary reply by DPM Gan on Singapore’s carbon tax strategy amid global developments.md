<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
<br><strong>WRITTEN ANSWER</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Mark Lee:</strong>&nbsp;To ask the Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister for Trade and Industry in light of the United States’ pull-back
from UN climate processes while Europe and regional partners remain engaged
at a calibrating pace (a) how does the Government assess implications for
Singapore’s carbon tax and sustainability pathway; and (b) whether there
is scope to recalibrate the pace of carbon tax increases to mitigate cost
pressures on local industries while meeting long-term climate commitments.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong (for the Prime Minister):</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government takes a pragmatic and calibrated approach in setting our
carbon tax trajectory, bearing in mind the pace of international climate
action, Singapore’s economic competitiveness, and the progress of decarbonisation
technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pace of global climate action will ebb and flow, as countries grapple
with different challenges in setting and meeting their climate ambition.&nbsp;
However, the increasingly severe impact of climate change means that all
countries will eventually be forced to take more drastic climate action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decarbonisation is necessary for Singapore to remain competitive in the
long-term as the world transits to a low-carbon future. As an alternative
energy-disadvantaged country, decarbonisation is more costly for us, hence,
our carbon tax must be high enough to incentivise investments to reduce
carbon emissions. We also need to plan early, given the longer lead time
needed to implement decarbonisation solutions. In addition, we have to
balance these considerations against nearer-term factors, including how
carbon is priced in other jurisdictions. This is to avoid carbon leakage,
where companies in Singapore relocate their emissive activities to other
jurisdictions with lower carbon prices, without resulting in any net decrease
in emissions globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ministry of Trade and Industry has been engaging businesses to address
their concerns and challenges with regard to the carbon tax as well as
mitigation measures, and to provide the necessary support and assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
