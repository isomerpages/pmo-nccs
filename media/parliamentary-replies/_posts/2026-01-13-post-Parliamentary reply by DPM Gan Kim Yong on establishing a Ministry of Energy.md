<p><strong>FIFTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE</strong>
<br><strong>WRITTEN ANSWER</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat:</strong>&nbsp;To ask the Prime Minister and
Minister for Finance given Singapore’s rapid energy transition efforts
and rising electricity demand from AI adoption, data centres, advanced
semiconductor and high-performance computing activities, as well as growing
EV consumer demand, whether the Government will consider establishing a
Ministry for Energy to coordinate long-term and operational energy needs,
decarbonisation pathways, grid resilience and international energy negotiations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong (for the Prime Minister):</strong>
</p>
<p>Striking the right balance between security, affordability and sustainability
in our energy system is a key priority for the Government. Today, the Ministry
of Trade and Industry (MTI), with its statutory board the Energy Market
Authority (EMA), directly oversees energy matters, and works closely with
the rest of Government to manage our energy transition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better organise the Government to accelerate Singapore’s transition
to cleaner energies, the Prime Minister designated Minister Dr Tan See
Leng as the Minister-in-charge of Energy last year. MTI has also appointed
a Permanent Secretary and a Deputy Secretary to oversee policies relating
to energy and decarbonisation. MTI set up a new Energy and Carbon cluster
in April 2024 to co-ordinate efforts across the whole-of-Government and
build the requisite capabilities. Currently, the Government has no plan
to set up a separate Ministry of Energy but we will continue to make refinements
to how this work is organised, as its scale and complexity grow in the
years ahead.</p>
