**FOURTEENTH PARLIAMENT OF SINGAPORE  
WRITTEN ANSWER**

**Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong:** To ask the Prime Minister whether the findings of the Public Consultation on Singapore's Climate Ambition will be published in full, prior to any formal revision of Singapore's Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy and 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution, before the end of 2022.

**Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister):**

The Public Consultation on Singapore’s Climate Ambition is part of our effort to engage multiple stakeholders following the announcement in Budget 2022 that Singapore will be raising our climate ambition. The Public Consultation closed on 26 September 2022 and builds on the series of engagement sessions with businesses, non-governmental organisations, green groups, and youths under the Singapore Green Plan 2030.

We have received close to 500 responses from the Public Consultation. We are currently studying the feedback, and will publish a summary report of the aggregated findings, prior to any formal revision of Singapore’s Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) and 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
