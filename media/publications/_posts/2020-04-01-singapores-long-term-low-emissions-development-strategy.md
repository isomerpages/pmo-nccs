Singapore's Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) document titled “Charting Singapore’s Low-Carbon and Climate Resilient Future”, builds on the enhanced NDC’s target by aspiring to halve our emissions from its peak to 33MtCO<sub>2</sub>e by 2050, with a view to achieving net zero emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century. 

In October 2022, Singapore announced that it will raise its national climate target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 as part of its LEDS.

To enable Singapore’s low-carbon transition, the LEDS will have three thrusts: 

a.	Transformations in industry, economy and society, e.g. more renewable energy, greater energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption;

b.	Adoption of advanced low-carbon technologies, e.g. carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and use of low-carbon fuels; and

c.	Effective international collaboration, e.g. international climate action, regional power grids, market-based mechanisms.
