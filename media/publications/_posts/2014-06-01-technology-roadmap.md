**Transforming our industry, economy and society with innovation**

To realise Singapore’s [Long-term Low-Emissions Development Strategy](https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media/publications/singapores-long-term-low-emissions-development-strategy), we need to constantly look at innovations to improve energy efficiency across the economy and implement a greater share of clean energy. We will also need to harness emerging solutions that can achieve mitigation outcomes beyond our existing range of options, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and low-carbon hydrogen.

**Understanding Emerging Low-Carbon Technologies**

As early as 2007, Singapore identified clean technology as a strategic area for research, innovation and enterprise, and has been investing in research and development (R&D) to increase energy efficiency, harness renewable energy and decarbonise our grid, industries, and buildings. This includes emerging technologies that are still in the developmental phase, e.g. CCUS and low-carbon hydrogen. Our ability to realise a low-carbon future will depend on the maturing of such technologies. 

The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) and partner agencies are studying the potential of promising technologies to reduce Singapore’s carbon emissions. The challenges to wide-spread adoption and the R&D needed to advance nascent technologies are other key areas in our technical studies. The government, academia and industry are working closely together. 

Taking reference from the studies, new programmes were launched to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies in solar photovoltaics, building energy efficiency, power systems, green data centres and waste-to-energy.  

As understanding of science and technology advances, the technical studies will be refreshed. 
An updated solar PV study has been completed and further studies on CCUS and hydrogen are underway.

**2013-2016 Technology Roadmaps**

From 2013-2016, NCCS and the [<a href="https://www.nrf.gov.sg/">National Research Foundation (NRF)</a>](https://www.nrf.gov.sg/) jointly commissioned seven Technology Roadmaps. The roadmaps studied the potential for current and new technologies to reduce Singapore’s long-term carbon emissions.

Each Roadmap highlights the pathways from R&D to deployment for technologies that can help increase energy efficiency, lower carbon emissions and increase energy security for Singapore up to 2030 and beyond. The Roadmaps also identified and prioritised technologies and actions required to accelerate the adoption of these technologies in the market.

These roadmaps provide references for government agencies’ research, development and demonstration funding initiatives (e.g. NTU’s Waste-to-Energy Research Facility, Green Building Innovation Cluster, Green Data Centre Programme) and supported the development of Singapore’s Paris Pledge.

Findings from five Roadmaps were presented at Energy TechRoadmap 2014, the inaugural technology roadmap symposium on Energy and Low Carbon Technologies in Singapore, held on 30 July 2014. The event was attended by about 700 participants from the public sector, academic and industry.

As part of Government's continuous effort to engage with industrial and academic stakeholders to accelerate the deployment of energy and low carbon technologies, three new Roadmaps were commissioned and launched at the Energy Innovation 2016, held on 3 June 2016.


**Technology Primers**

Prior to the Technology Roadmaps, NCCS and NRF jointly commissioned a series of Technology Primers in 2011. The Primers sought to understand how various technologies could help Singapore increase energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, and increase energy options. Each Primer discussed the state of a technology, its technical feasibility for Singapore, related research activities in Singapore and possible research goals.
