On 4 November 2022, Singapore submitted its second update to the 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution and an Addendum to Singapore’s Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Addendum to the LEDS captures Singapore’s raised national climate target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. It builds on the [LEDS submitted in 2020](https://www.nccs.gov.sg/files/docs/default-source/publications/nccsleds.pdf), which laid out a target of halving our emissions from their peak to 33 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e by 2050, with a view to achieving net zero emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century. The targets are contingent on the maturity of decarbonisation technologies and effective international cooperation. Singapore’s ability to fulfil these pledges, like all Parties, will depend on the continued international commitment by Parties to the Paris Agreement and their climate pledges.

To achieve net zero by 2050, Singapore is accelerating the low-carbon transition for industry, economy and society through four key thrusts:

a. Catalysing business transformation, e.g. improving energy efficiency, shifting towards a more sustainable Energy and Chemicals sector; 

b. Investing in low-carbon technologies, e.g. carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and use of low-carbon fuels; 

c. Pursuing effective international cooperation, e.g. international climate action, regional power grids, market-based mechanisms; and 

d. Adopting low-carbon practices, e.g. greener commutes with cleaner vehicles and Walk-Cycle-Ride. 

These thrusts are supported by [Singapore’s revised carbon tax](https://www.nccs.gov.sg/media/press-release/singapore-will-raise-climate-ambition), as a key enabler of this transition.
