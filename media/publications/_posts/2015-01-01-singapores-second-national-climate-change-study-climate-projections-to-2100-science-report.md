The Second National Climate Change Study for Singapore provides information on anticipated climate change. The study is being carried out in two phases. Phase 1 projects the changes in main climate variables of interest to Singapore (e.g. temperature, rainfall, sea level rise). Phase 2 makes use of the projections from Phase 1 to examine the climate change impacts on areas such as water resource and drainage, biodiversity and greenery, network infrastructure and building infrastructure.
