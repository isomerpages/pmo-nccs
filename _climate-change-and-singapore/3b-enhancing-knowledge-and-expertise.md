### ENHANCING KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE

Research is a key factor to enhancing our understanding of climate science so that we can develop effective adaptation measures. An understanding of regional and local climate is essential to building resilience, as we are located in an area at high risk to the effects of climate change.

This is why we are augmenting our expertise in climate and weather science within the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) and local research institutions, and by forming partnerships with international experts.

*Enhancing our capabilities in climate modelling and climate science will enable Singapore to better prepare itself to adapt to climate change.*

**Amassing Knowledge in Local Climate Change**  
Our local research institutes are providing invaluable knowledge on climate change and coastal protection through applied research. Their work on local climate modelling is also important, as regional or global data does not fully account for the variations in our climate and weather patterns.

**Centre for Climate Research Singapore**  
The MSS established the [<a href="https://ccrs.weather.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS)</a>](https://ccrs.weather.gov.sg/) to improve the nation's capabilities in climate science and modelling. The CCRS will anchor climate science capabilities in Singapore over the long term. The CCRS will collaborate with our universities and leading climate centres in other countries to spearhead impact studies that will support Whole-of-Government efforts in climate resilience.

The National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have also set up the following centres to aid in applied research:

**Singapore-Delft Water Alliance (SDWA), NUS**  
[<a href="http://blog.nus.edu.sg/sdwa/" target="_blank">SDWA</a>](http://blog.nus.edu.sg/sdwa/) conducts research using environmental sensing, intelligent data processing and modelling to improve our knowledge of the water cycle. Other capabilities include real-time forecasting and warning by simulating and analysing extreme weather events to develop decision support systems.

**Tropical Marine Science Institute (TMSI), NUS**  
[<a href="http://www.tmsi.nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank">TMSI</a>](http://www.tmsi.nus.edu.sg/) is a centre of excellence that conducts R&D and consultancy in both tropical marine and climate science. Its multidisciplinary research labs and international partnerships allow for investigation into physical oceanography, acoustics, marine biology, marine mammals, biofuels, water resources and climate change. TMSI contributed to Phase 1 of the Climate Change Study and is assisting Singapore with the Risk Map Study.

**Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS), NTU**  
[<a href="https://earthobservatory.sg/" target="_blank">EOS</a>](https://earthobservatory.sg/) conducts research that seeks to make accurate predictions of the regional consequences that can be expected from climate change. Currently, EOS is studying how sea surface temperature, saltiness and water circulation have affected Southeast Asian monsoons in the past. This knowledge can help us to make informed decisions when planning future drainage systems.
