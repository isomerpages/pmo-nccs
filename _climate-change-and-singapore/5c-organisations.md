### WHAT CAN YOUR ORGANISATION DO?

**Become Part of the National Effort to Tackle Climate Change**

Organisations can play their part in reducing emissions by understanding the environmental impact of their business operations and by adopting carbon-friendly measures and practices.

**Be Part of the Solution**

Your organisation can help in the fight against climate change in a number of ways. As part of practising corporate social responsibility (CSR), you can take steps to reduce your organisation's carbon footprint or organise activities to promote community and stakeholder action on climate change.

You can also get involved in the adoption and/or development of green technology solutions aimed at reducing your corporate carbon footprint.
