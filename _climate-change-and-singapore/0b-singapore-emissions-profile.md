### SINGAPORE'S EMISSIONS PROFILE

Singapore contributes around 0.11 per cent of global emissions. We are nevertheless taking steps to reduce our carbon emissions.

Historically, our strategic position along the East-West trade routes has made Singapore a natural location for oil storage and refining facilities serving the region. Building on our position as a key regional port, the refining and petrochemical plants help create synergies and are part of a business supply network in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, South Asia and Australasia. Although, the refining and petrochemical sector is a large source of our carbon emissions, Singapore is working on an on-going and continuous basis to improve our levels of energy efficiency.

**Carbon Intensity (Emissions per $GDP)**

Singapore ranks 126th of 142 countries in terms of CO2 emissions per dollar GDP, based on International Energy Agency (IEA) data.

**Projected 2020 Business-As-Usual Greenhouse Gas Emissions**

Projecting from 2005, our business-as-usual (BAU) emissions are expected to reach 77.2 million tonnes (MT) in 2020.
