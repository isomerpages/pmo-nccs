### INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS

The causes and impacts of global climate change can only be addressed effectively by a concerted international effort. Every country needs to play its part to reduce global concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

As a small low-lying city-state with an open economy, Singapore is particularly vulnerable to the consequence of climate change. We have a deep interest in global efforts to address potential disruptions to natural ecosystems and human societies. Singapore has always been a strong supporter of multilateral approaches to global issues, and we work closely with other countries to tackle the climate challenge.

**The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change**

At the centre of the global effort is the [UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](http://unfccc.int/), which sets the framework for governments to cooperate to address climate change, based on the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances". International negotiations have been ongoing under the UNFCCC since the 1990s to increase international action on climate change.

At Paris in December 2015, Parties to the UNFCCC adopted a landmark global climate agreement. The Paris Agreement will replace the Kyoto Protocol when it expires in 2020 and will require all countries to take action to address climate change. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the commitment by all nations towards the UN multilateral framework to address the challenges of climate change.

Singapore has been an active player in the international climate change negotiations. We ratified the UNFCCC in 1997, and acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 2006. We further ratified the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol in 2014. Under the UNFCCC process, we have been, and will continue to work with other parties to advance the international climate change agenda.
