### WASTE AND WATER

**Combating Waste Emissions**

Our overall waste management strategy aims to reduce emissions from waste through the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle), and by incinerating the remaining refuse in waste-to-energy plants. Incineration is preferable to land filling, since the direct burial of waste produces methane, a greenhouse gas.

We aim to improve our current recycling rate of 59% to 70% by 2030 by looking into different ways to reduce emissions. This includes the policy of recycling more plastic waste instead of incinerating it.

**Reducing Methane from Wastewater**

We also seek to reduce direct methane emissions from wastewater sludge through incineration. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and ECO-Special Waste Management (ECO-SWM) have collaborated on the development of one of Southeast Asia's largest sludge incineration plants in Singapore.

With an estimated annual average reduction of 129,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e), the plant has been registered as an emissions reduction project with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and will generate carbon credits in Singapore.

**Reducing Energy Usage by Desalination**

Desalinated water is one of Singapore's water supply sources, meeting about 10% of the country's water needs. We have been investing in R&D to improve the energy efficiency of the desalination process. One such project uses electrochemical desalting to reduce energy usage to less than half the volume currently being used by membrane-based desalination methods.
