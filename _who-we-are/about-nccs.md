### About NCCS

The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) was established on 1 July 2010 under the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office (PMO) to develop and implement Singapore's domestic and international policies and strategies to tackle climate change. NCCS is part of the Strategy Group which supports the Prime Minister and his Cabinet to establish priorities and strengthen strategic alignment across Government. The inclusion of NCCS enhances strategy-making and planning on vital issues that span multiple Government ministries and agencies.

NCCS' areas of responsibility are to:

* harness economic and green growth opportunities arising from climate change  
* encourage public awareness and action on climate change
