### INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

**1. What is the Paris Agreement?**

The 2015 Paris Agreement is the first global legally-binding pact on climate change, where both developed and developing countries undertake measures to address climate change. It builds on the momentum of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted ahead of COP-21 by over 185 Parties, covering 94 per cent of global emissions and 97 per cent of the global population.

**2. What does the Paris Agreement mean for Singapore?**

With the adoption of the Paris climate agreement, Singapore will work towards fulfilling our pledge to reduce our emissions intensity by 36 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, and to stabilise our emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030. In line with our pre-2020 pledge at Copenhagen, we will also reduce our emissions by 16 per cent below the Business-As-Usual (BAU) level in 2020.

**3. How else is Singapore contributing to international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?**

Singapore provides assistance to other developing countries through technical cooperation and capacity building programmes. We regularly share our experience with other countries to enhance global capability.  We have set up a dedicated technical assistance programme on Sustainable development and climate change under the [<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SCPFriends" target="_blank">Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP)</a>](https://www.facebook.com/SCPFriends) to share our experiences in these areas with other developing countries. Since 2012, we have trained over 112,000 officials.
