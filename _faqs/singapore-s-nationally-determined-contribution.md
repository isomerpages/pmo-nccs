### SINGAPORE'S NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION

**1. What does Emissions Intensity mean?**

Emissions Intensity refers to the amount of greenhouse gas emitted per dollar GDP. It is a measure of how efficient a country is in terms of greenhouse gas emissions relative to its economic activities.

Singapore has chosen an Emissions Intensity reduction target as this is consistent with our approach to achieve growth in a sustainable manner. Moreover, Emissions Intensity can be computed and compared across countries, which makes it a useful benchmark.

**2. In terms of absolute emissions, where will Singapore be after a 36 per cent reduction in Emissions Intensity?**

Under our pledge, Singapore's emissions could stabilise at around 65 MTCO2e in 2030 based on current projected emissions growth.

**3. How does Singapore intend to meet its target?**

Given Singapore's limited renewable energy options, improving energy efficiency in various sectors of the economy will be our key strategy for further reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.

We have measures in place in every sector to help companies improve their energy efficiency. These include grants and incentive schemes, such as Efficiency Grant for Energy Efficiency and Green Mark incentive schemes for buildings.

In addition, under the Energy Conservation Act (ECA) that was implemented in Apr 2013, large energy consumers in Singapore are required to appoint an energy manager, monitor and report energy use and greenhouse gas emissions annually, and submit energy efficiency improvement plans annually. Through ECA, companies will be in a better position to implement suitable energy efficient measures to reduce their emissions.

The Carbon Tax that was implemented from January 2019 also creates a price signal to incentivise behaviour change.

Despite its limited renewable energy options, Singapore is continuing its efforts in research and development in new technologies for innovative solutions to climate change. These include increasing both floating and offshore solar deployment.
