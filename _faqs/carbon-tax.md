### CARBON TAX

**1. What is the role of the carbon tax in Singapore’s mitigation strategy?**

The carbon tax forms part of our comprehensive suite of mitigation measures by providing a broad-based price signal across the economy, to achieve our climate targets. The carbon tax provides a broad-based price signal to encourage companies to reduce their emissions, yet gives them the flexibility to take action where it makes the most economic sense. This will accelerate the economic transformation necessary to transition to a future-ready green economy by enhancing the business case to implement energy efficiency improvements and other emission reduction solutions. This ensures the long-term viability of business investments and activities in a carbon-constrained world. 

**2. Who is covered under the carbon tax?**

To maintain a transparent, fair, and consistent price signal across the economy, the carbon tax is applied uniformly to all sectors including energy-intensive and trade-exposed sectors, without exemption.

The tax is applied on facilities that directly emit at least 25,000 tCO<sub>2</sub>e of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually, and includes the six GHGs that Singapore is currently reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) – namely carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>). 

It covers 80% of our total GHG emissions from about 50 facilities mainly from the manufacturing, power, waste, and water sectors. Facilities in other sectors would also indirectly face a carbon price on the electricity they consume as power generation companies will pass on some degree of their own tax cost through increased electricity tariffs. When we account for the carbon price component within fuel excise duties for transport emissions, the overall coverage rises to about 90%.

**3. Which other countries or jurisdictions have implemented carbon pricing?**

Singapore is not alone in pricing carbon. About 78 jurisdictions (46 national and 32 sub-national jurisdictions) have implemented, or have plans to implement, carbon pricing. These jurisdictions account for roughly half of global greenhouse gas emissions. A few of these jurisdictions such as Finland, Norway and Sweden have implemented carbon pricing as early as the 1990s.

**4. What does our carbon tax measures under the Singapore Green Plan mean for individuals?**
Our strategies for climate action, including the carbon tax, take into account the needs of all stakeholders, including the low-income and the vulnerable.

Under the whole-of-nation Singapore Green Plan 2030, we have designed our range of adaption and mitigation measures to be inclusive and equitable. Not only do Tthese measures support the building of a city in nature, an energy reset and a transition to a green economy, the measures also aim to build a resilient future for all, and to minimise the adverse effects that climate change could have on the economy, society and on our daily lives. 

For example, the Government has been improving the liveability of our public housing estates through novel ways of weaving greenery into our estates and towns, which reduces temperatures while improving air quality. HDB flats are also designed to maximise cross-ventilation, thereby reducing reliance on air-conditioning which is a large contributor to household utility bills. Other Another initiatives include is maximising cross-ventilation through the design of HDB flats and promoting sustainable living with the introduction of energy-efficient centralised cooling systems in new HDB towns to support cooling. Coupled with the 10-year HDB Green Towns Programme’s initiatives, energy consumption is further reduced as towns become cooler. These sustainability initiatives ensure that the impact of climate change on all residents, including low-income groups,  are minimised.

The Government also provides support to help households reduce their emissions. Since December 2020, the Government has introduced incentives such as e-Vouchers ranging from $25 to $150 in value under the Climate Friendly Households Programme to support lower-income households in purchasing more energy efficient and climate-friendly appliances. These e-Vouchers can be used to purchase appliances such as 3-ticks water efficient shower fittings (inclusive of installation costs if required) and energy efficient and climate-friendly refrigerators. With the adoption of these appliances, households are able to do their part for the environment by reducing their energy and water consumption while saving costs in the long run. 

To help households adjust to the impact of the carbon tax on their electricity and gas expenses, eligible HDB households are given an additional $20 GST Voucher – U-Save on top of the regular U-Save rebate each year from 2019 to 2021. Eligible households living in smaller HDB flats benefit more as they receive a larger quantum of U-Save rebates, and typically have smaller annual utilities bills. 



**6. How would the Government ensure that consumers are not over-charged by electricity retailers passing on more than 100 per cent of the carbon tax to consumers?**

Today's electricity retail market is competitive and discourages retailers from raising their electricity rates excessively. Nevertheless, EMA will continue to ensure fair and efficient conduct of market players. Government agencies will also work closely with the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) and Competition & Consumer Commission of Singapore to monitor the market for unfair pricing and coordinated price hikes which are anti-competitive.

**7. How would my electricity price plan under the Open Electricity Market be affected by the carbon tax?**

With the rollout of the Open Electricity Market from 2018, small<sup>[1]</sup> consumers who have bought standard price plans will continue to pay the electricity rate contracted with their retailers even when the carbon tax was implemented on 1 January 2019. This is because the electricity rate under standard price plans are inclusive of all applicable charges, i.e. consumers’ contracted electricity rate will not change during the contract duration even after the carbon tax comes into effect.

For non-standard price plans, retailers who wish to exercise the contractual right to adjust the electricity rate, and/or add a new charge for contracted consumers due to genuine rise in business costs (e.g. carbon tax) even if the contract provides for this, *shall seek EMA’s prior approval*. Specifically, for carbon tax, the retailer is required to provide the following information to EMA as part of the approval process:

-Justification on the amount of carbon tax to be imposed and how it is calculated; and

-Communications and customer engagement plan.
