### MITIGATION EFFORTS

Singapore has committed to achieving net zero by 2050. Despite the challenging geographical constraints we face, we will continue to find innovative ways to accelerate the low-carbon transition for industry, economy and society through four key thrusts:

*   Catalysing business transformation;
*   Investing in low-carbon technologies;
*   Pursuing effective international cooperation; and
*   Adopting low-carbon practices.

They are supported by the carbon tax, as a key enabler of this transition.

Find out how each sector of the economy is playing its 
part to decarbonize.
