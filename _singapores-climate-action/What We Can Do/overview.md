### WHAT WE CAN DO

Over the years, Singapore has spared no effort in our mission for sustainable development. 

From designating 2018 as the [<a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2018-12-14-newsletter-year-of-climate-action-key-initiatives/" target="_blank">Year of Climate Action</a>](https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2018-12-14-newsletter-year-of-climate-action-key-initiatives/) to the annual [<a href="https://mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-08-14-press-release-on-singapore-climate-action-week/" target="_blank">Climate Action Week</a>](https://mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-08-14-press-release-on-singapore-climate-action-week/), the government has made significant efforts to rally for collective action. In 2019, the [<a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-09-26-speech-on-reducing-excessive-consumption-of-disposables/" target="_blank">#RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup</a>](https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-09-26-speech-on-reducing-excessive-consumption-of-disposables/) was convened to look at how to improve household recycling In 2020, the [<a href="https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2020/11/EST-Press-Release---19-Nov-2020.pdf" target="_blank">Alliances for Action</a>](https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2020/11/EST-Press-Release---19-Nov-2020.pdf), as well as conversations on sustainability to [<a href="https://emergingstronger.sg/" target="_blank">emerge stronger</a>](https://emergingstronger.sg/) together with citizens, businesses, and NGOs were started.

In Feb 2021, the government has put together a ten-year plan called the Singapore Green Plan 2030. The Green Plan is a whole-of-nation sustainable development agenda, with firm action plans, touching on almost every dimension of our lives.
