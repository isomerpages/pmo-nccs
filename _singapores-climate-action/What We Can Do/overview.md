<h3>WHAT WE CAN DO</h3>
<p>Over the years, Singapore has spared no effort in our mission for sustainable
development.</p>
<p>From designating 2018 as the <a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2018-12-14-newsletter-year-of-climate-action-key-initiatives/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Year of Climate Action</a> to
the annual <a href="https://mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-08-14-press-release-on-singapore-climate-action-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Climate Action Week</a>,
the government has made significant efforts to rally for collective action.
In 2019, the <a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-09-26-speech-on-reducing-excessive-consumption-of-disposables/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">#RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup</a> was
convened to look at how to improve household recycling In 2020, the <a href="https://www.mti.gov.sg/newsroom/the-emerging-stronger-taskforce-offers-a-glimpse-into-a-future-economy-that-is-connected-and-sustainable/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Alliances for Action</a>,
as well as conversations on sustainability to emerge stronger together
with citizens, businesses, and NGOs were started.</p>
<p>In Feb 2021, the government has put together a ten-year plan called the
Singapore Green Plan 2030. The Green Plan is a whole-of-nation sustainable
development agenda, with firm action plans, touching on almost every dimension
of our lives.</p>
<p>In 2022, Singapore announced its commitment to achieve net zero emissions
by 2050.</p>
<p>In Feb 2025, Singapore submitted its 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution.
Singapore is committed to reduce our emissions to between 45 and 50 million
tonnes of carbon equivalent (MtCO<sub>2</sub>e) in 2035.</p>
