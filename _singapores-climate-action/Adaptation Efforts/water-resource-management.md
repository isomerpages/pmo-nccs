<h3>WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</h3>
<p>Climate change can affect Singapore’s water supply due to increasingly
irregular rainfall patterns, including more frequent and extended periods
of dry weather. As a nation with limited water supply, achieving water
resilience is a priority. Singapore has established a robust and diversified
water management system through the Four National Taps:</p>

<p>Desalinated water</p>

<p><strong>Our Weather-Resilient Water Sources</strong>
</p>
<p>NEWater and desalinated water are weather-resilient sources and not dependent
on rainfall. They have become increasingly important water sources that
can strengthen Singapore’s water resilience.</p>
<p>PUB is committed to ensuring a diversified and sustainable water supply
through our Four National Taps. As demand for water continues to increase
as our population and economy grow, it continues to plan ahead and invest
in water infrastructure to ensure long-term resilience and sustainability
of our water resources.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting water conservation and water efficiency</strong>
</p>
<p>Alongside ensuring a resilient water supply system, PUB also engages households
and industries to conserve water to ensure sustainable growth in long-term
water demand. In addition to pricing water to reflect its scarcity and
encourage its sustainable use, PUB has introduced initiatives to manage
water demand. These include:</p>
<p>Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme, to help households make well-informed
choices when purchasing water fittings.</p>
<p>Mandatory water recycling requirements for new projects in specific water-intensive
industries (e.g. water fabrication, electronics, biomedical and pharmaceuticals)
from 2024, as well as the Water Efficiency Fund to encourage companies
to seek continuous improvement in water efficiency.</p>
