<h3>ADAPTATION EFFORTS</h3>
<p>Climate change affects Singapore's annual mean temperature, which has
risen by 0.24°C per decade from 1984 to 2022. The recent ten years in 2010-2019
was the warmest decade on record at 27.95°C. The daily rainfall totals
and frequency of days with heavier rainfall have also risen.</p>
<p>Additionally, the mean sea level is also projected to rise by 0.23m to
1.15m by the end of the century. This makes adaptation measures a necessity
for Singapore to prepare for the effects and to increase resilience to
the effects of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore's Approach to Adaptation</strong>
<br>Singapore has started making early preparations to adapt to the impact
of climate change. At the same time, our understanding of climate change
is continually evolving. To address the projected effects of climate change
over the next 50 to 100 years, the government has introduced a resilience
framework to guide our efforts in safeguarding Singapore over the long
term.</p>
