<h3>DRAINAGE AND FLOOD PROTECTION</h3>
<p><strong>Enhancing Our Flood Resilience</strong>
</p>
<p>With climate change, rainfall events could increase in frequency and intensity.
PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency adopts a four-pronged approach towards
flood management which comprises (1) Drainage Infrastructure, (2) Legislation,
(3) Flood Response Operations and (4) Community Resilience</p>
<p><strong>Drainage Infrastructure</strong>
</p>
<p>PUB has an extensive drainage system comprising 8,000km of drains, rivers,
and canals that channel rainwater to our reservoirs or the sea. Significant
investments have been made over the decades to upgrade drainage infrastructure.
However, it may not always be feasible or cost-effective to build bigger
drains and infrastructure to cater to every extreme rainfall scenario due
to Singapore’s land constraints. Hence,&nbsp;PUB also adopts holistic stormwater
management through the “Source-Pathway-Receptor” approach. Beyond drainage
upgrading (i.e. “Pathway” solutions), stormwater is also managed where
it falls (i.e. through “Source” solutions such as on-site detention tanks
in buildings) and at the areas where floodwaters may flow (i.e. through
“Receptor” measures such as flood barriers, and minimum crest and platform
levels to be incorporated by developments).</p>

</p>
<p>Through this approach, stormwater management is addressed across all parts
of the drainage system, with building owners and developers playing a role
in managing flood risks and the potential impact on their developments.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Legislation</strong>
</p>
<p>Developments must adhere to requirements such as minimum crest and platform
levels to minimise flood risks. Amendments to the Sewerage and Drainage
Act were also passed in November 2024 to ensure that owners and developers
carry out proper maintenance of their stormwater drainage systems and flood
protection measures within their premises.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Flood Response Operations</strong>
</p>
<p>PUB’s comprehensive suite of flood response measures consist of rainfall
monitoring and forecasting, early warning and ground deployment of Quick
Response Teams to ensure public safety.</p>
<p><strong>Community Resilience</strong>
</p>
<p>Community resilience will need to be strengthened by creating awareness
of flood risks, fostering acceptance that flooding could occur from time
to time and motivating communities to take action to plan and protect against
flooding.&nbsp; Everyone has a role to play in ensuring Singapore’s flood
resilience. Through its timely forecasting and warning service, PUB provides
information to the community to help them better prepare and respond to
flood incidents. PUB engages residents and businesses in flood-prone areas
on flood risks, distributes flood protection devices and organises community
exercises to enhance flood preparedness in these premises.&nbsp;</p>
