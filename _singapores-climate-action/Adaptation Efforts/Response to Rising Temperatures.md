<h3><strong>RESPONSE TO RISING TEMPERATURES</strong></h3>
<p>According to the V3 stakeholder report, Singapore experiences an average
of 21.4 very hot days annually, defined as days with daily maximum temperature
exceeding 35°C. This number is projected to worsen, rising to 129 very
hot days annually by 2050 under a high-emissions scenario. It is important
to be prepared for rising temperatures to ensure Singapore remains liveable,
and safeguard health and productivity.</p>
<p><strong>National Heat Resilience Strategy</strong>
</p>
<p>The Government adopts a science-based and proactive heat resilience strategy,
which has three prongs:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Implementing national-level cooling strategies to benefit all segments of our society.</u>
<br>This includes strategies to cool our urban environment, such as urban
planning and building design to improve air flow and ventilation, greenery
and cool materials, and use of energy efficient cooling technologies to
reduce the amount of waste heat and greenhouse gases generated.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Deepening our scientific understanding of the impact of rising temperatures. </u>
<br>CCRS has released the results of Singapore’s Third National Climate Change
Study (V3), which provides the world’s highest resolution climate projections
for Singapore and Southeast Asia, including for heat. These updated projections
will be used to guide climate adaptation plans so that Singapore remains
resilient. We will continue to invest in heat resilience research and development.
For example, we are developing environmental modelling and simulation to
better understand the contributors to heat and assess effectiveness of
cooling strategies, as well as studying the impacts of rising heat on human
health and other conditions.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Strengthening the community’s resilience, especially among more vulnerable population segments.</u> 
<br>We are empowering the community to cope with a warming world, including
by launching the <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/new-heat-stress-advisory-launched-to-guide-public-on-minimising-risk-of-heat-related-illnesses" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Heat Stress Advisory</a> to
guide the public on ways to minimise the risk of heat stress. There are
also enhanced guidelines to protect specific groups of our population,
such as outdoor workers. In addition, we are progressively deploying more
Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature sensors in other parts of Singapore, including
residential districts. Such sensors will augment the HSA and sector-specific
guidelines, and enable the Government to better quantify, track and monitor
heat in Singapore. We have also developed heatwave response plans for both
public and sector-specific populations.</p>
