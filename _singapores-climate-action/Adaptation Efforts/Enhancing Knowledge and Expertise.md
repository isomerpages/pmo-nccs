<h3>ENHANCING KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE</h3>
<p>Research is a key factor to enhancing our understanding of climate science
so that we can develop effective adaptation measures. An understanding
of regional and local climate is essential to building resilience, as we
are located in an area at high risk to the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>This is why we are augmenting our expertise in climate and weather science
within the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) and local research institutions,
and by forming partnerships with international experts.</p>

<p><em>Enhancing our capabilities in climate modelling and climate science will enable Singapore to better prepare itself to adapt to climate change.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Amassing Knowledge in Local Climate Change</strong>
<br>Our local research institutes are providing invaluable knowledge on climate
change and coastal protection through applied research. Their work on local
climate modelling is also important, as regional or global data does not
fully account for the variations in our climate and weather patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Centre for Climate Research Singapore</strong>
<br>The MSS established the <a href="https://ccrs.weather.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS)</a> to
improve the nation's capabilities in climate science and modelling. The
CCRS will anchor climate science capabilities in Singapore over the long
term. The CCRS will collaborate with our universities and leading climate
centres in other countries to spearhead impact studies that will support
Whole-of-Government efforts in climate resilience.</p>
<p>The National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University
(NTU) have also set up the following centres to aid in applied research:</p>
<p><strong>Singapore-Delft Water Alliance (SDWA), NUS</strong>
<br><a href="http://blog.nus.edu.sg/sdwa/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SDWA</a> conducts
research using environmental sensing, intelligent data processing and modelling
to improve our knowledge of the water cycle. Other capabilities include
real-time forecasting and warning by simulating and analysing extreme weather
events to develop decision support systems.</p>
<p><strong>Tropical Marine Science Institute (TMSI), NUS</strong>
<br><a href="http://www.tmsi.nus.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TMSI</a> is
a centre of excellence that conducts R&amp;D and consultancy in both tropical
marine and climate science. Its multidisciplinary research labs and international
partnerships allow for investigation into physical oceanography, acoustics,
marine biology, marine mammals, biofuels, water resources and climate change.
TMSI contributed to Phase 1 of the Climate Change Study and is assisting
Singapore with the <a href="/singapores-climate-action/coastal-protection/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Risk Map Study</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS), NTU</strong>
<br><a href="https://earthobservatory.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">EOS</a> conducts
research that seeks to make accurate predictions of the regional consequences
that can be expected from climate change. Currently, EOS is studying how
sea surface temperature, saltiness and water circulation have affected
Southeast Asian monsoons in the past. This knowledge can help us to make
informed decisions when planning future drainage systems.</p>
