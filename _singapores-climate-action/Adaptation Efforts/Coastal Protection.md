<h3>COASTAL PROTECTION</h3>
<p>As a highly urbanised, densely populated and low-lying coastal city with
abundant rainfall, it is a priority to strengthen Singapore's resilience
against both inland and coastal flooding.</p>
<p>According to the Third National Climate Change Study, mean sea level is
expected to rise up to 1.15 metres by 2100. Coupled with storm surges and
high tides, sea levels could rise up to 5 metres. Singapore is particularly
vulnerable to the threat of sea level rise, as around 30 per cent of our
island is less than 5 metres above mean sea level.</p>
<p>PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency manages both inland and coastal
floods holistically and leads and coordinates whole-of-government efforts
in ensuring coastal and flood resilience.</p>
<p>Since 2021, Singapore has progressively commenced site-specific studies
(SSS) at various sections of the coastline to develop tailored coastal
protection measures. The SSS for City-East Coast, which covers the Greater
Southern Waterfront, Changi and the East Coast, was completed in 2025.</p>

<p>The SSS for City-East Coast has recommended building coastal barriers
at the Greater Southern Waterfront, as well as a mixture of raised structures
and tidal gates at Changi. These measures will be multi-functional spaces
and protect Singapore from coastal flooding. Further studies will be carried
out to develop a detailed design of the measures.</p>

<p>The ‘Long Island’ project announced in 2023 will protect the entire East
Coast area. The project entails reclaiming about 800 hectares of land off
the East Coast, potentially in the form of ‘islands’. It will protect the
low-lying areas from sea level rise, strengthen Singapore’s flood resilience,
enhance water supply resilience with a new reservoir, and create additional
land to meet future development needs.</p>
<p>In tandem with the SSS, new coastal protection legislation and a Code
of Practice are also being developed to support the effective implementation,
operation and maintenance of new coastal protection measures.</p>
<p><strong>Strengthening capabilities</strong>
<br>In 2023, PUB launched the Coastal Protection and Flood Management Research
Programme (CFRP) to develop innovative, integrated, sustainable, and smart
solutions.</p>
<p>Under the CFRP, PUB, in partnership with the National University of Singapore
(NUS), launched the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI)
Singapore. It is Singapore’s first Centre of Excellence dedicated to strengthening
local capabilities and expertise in coastal protection and flood management
research and solutioning.</p>
<p>In addition to CFI Singapore, the CFRP will accelerate the translation
of technologies for application and facilitate test-bedding of new solutions
through its&nbsp;<strong>Applied Research</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Living Lab</strong>&nbsp;components
respectively.</p>
