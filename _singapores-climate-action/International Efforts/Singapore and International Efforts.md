### SINGAPORE AND INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS

The causes and impacts of climate change can only be addressed effectively by a concerted international effort. Every country needs to play its part to reduce global concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and adapt to the impact of climate change.

As a small low-lying city-state with an open economy, Singapore is particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. We have a deep interest in global efforts to address potential disruptions to natural ecosystems and human societies. Singapore has always engaged actively in multilateral approaches to global issues, and we work closely with other countries to tackle the climate challenge.

**The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change**

At the centre of the global effort is the [UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/), which sets the framework for governments to cooperate to address climate change, based on the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances". International negotiations have been ongoing under the UNFCCC since the 1990s to increase international action on climate change.

At Paris in December 2015, Parties to the UNFCCC adopted a landmark global climate agreement. The Paris Agreement  reaffirmed the commitment of the global community to advance the UN multilateral framework to address the challenges of climate change.

Singapore has been an active player in the international climate change negotiations. We ratified the UNFCCC in 1997, and acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 2006. We further ratified the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol in 2014, and signed the Paris Agreement on 22 April 2016 and ratified it on 21 September 2016. Under the UNFCCC process, we have been, and will continue to work with other parties to advance the international climate change agenda.

**Singapore’s Progress in Reducing Emissions**

In 2009, prior to the UNFCCC Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Singapore pledged to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 16 per cent below business-as-usual (BAU) levels in 2020. Singapore has achieved this pledge - our 2020 emissions of 52.8MtCO<sub>2</sub>e is equivalent to 32 per cent below its BAU levels, using 2005 as the reference year.

In December 2015, in line with the agreement adopted in Paris, Singapore made a further commitment to reduce our Emissions Intensity by 36 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, and stabilise our greenhouse gas emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030.

On 31 March 2020, Singapore submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) document to the UNFCCC. Singapore's NDC stated an absolute emissions target to peak emissions at 65 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e around 2030. Singapore’s LEDS built on the 2030 NDC by aspiring to halve emissions from its peak to 33 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e by 2050, with a view to achieving net zero emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century.

On 18 February 2022, Singapore announced that its raised ambition to achieve net zero emissions by or around mid-century. 

From April to October 2022, as part of efforts under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the Government engaged more than 1,700 members of the public and stakeholders on Singapore's climate ambition. Across these various engagements, there was agreement on the need for Singapore to increase its climate ambition.

Subsequently in October 2022, Singapore announced that it will raise its national climate target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 as part of its LEDS. It will also reduce emissions to around 60MtCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2030 after peaking emissions earlier as part of its enhanced 2030 NDC. These are contingent on technological maturity and effective international cooperation. Singapore's ability to fulfil these pledges, like many Parties, will depend on the continued international commitment by Parties to the Paris Agreement and their climate pledges.

In February 2025, Singapore submitted its 2035 NDC, commiting to reducing emissions to between 45 to 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO<sub>2</sub>e). We are among 13 countries who did so on time, out a total of 195 countries. Our 2035 NDC also underscores our commitment to maintain a competitive economy as we transition into a low-carbon world. Our 2035 NDC builds on our enhanced 2030 NDC and is aligned with our LEDS.

**Promoting International Co-operation on Climate Change**

Singapore also participates in other multilateral efforts that support a comprehensive and holistic approach to dealing with climate change including discussions under the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Singapore is supporting the IPCC Working Group II (WGII) on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, which is co-chaired by Singaporeans elected member of the IPCC Bureau, Professor Winston Chow in the AR7, together with Professor Bart van den Hurk who is based in the Netherlands. Singapore has been funding the establishment and operations of the Singapore branch of the Technical Support Unit (TSU) hosted at the Singapore Management University (SMU) since February 2024. In addition to leading the next cycle of work in the AR7 to assess climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerabilities, the IPCC WGII will also lead the development of the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Cities (SR Cities), which aims to provide a comprehensive assessment on cities in the context of climate change. 

We actively engage in environmental cooperation through bilateral and regional platforms such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Singapore is a partner in key regional initiatives, such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city project with China, and our collaboration with Jambi Province in Indonesia to improve peat land management and promote sustainable land use practices.

During COP-26 in Glasgow in November 2021, Singapore joined the following initiatives that strengthen our collective global climate action: the Powering Past Coal Alliance and the Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement; the Global Methane Pledge; the Greening Government Initiative (GGI); the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM4C); and the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use.

At COP-27 in Sharm El-Sheikh in November 2022, Singapore joined several global initiatives including the Forests and Climate Leaders’ Partnership (FCLP), the UN Global Early Warnings Initiative (GEWI) and the Green Shipping Challenge. Singapore also signed the [Joint Declaration from Energy Importers and Exporters on Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Fossil Fuels](https://2021-2025.state.gov/joint-declaration-from-energy-importers-and-exporters-on-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-fossil-fuels/).

During COP-28 in Dubai in November 2023, Singapore signed the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge, the Emirates Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems, and Climate Action, the Global Cooling Pledge, and the Declaration of Intent on Mutual Recognition of Certification Schemes for Hydrogen and Derivatives.

At COP-29 in Baku in November 2024, Singapore supported 9 key pledges/declarations, and initiatives launched by the COP29 Presidency: (i) COP29 Hydrogen Declaration; (ii) COP29 Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge; (iii) COP29 Green Energy Zones and Corridors Pledge; (iv) COP29 Truce Appeal; (v) COP29 Declaration on Reducing Methane from Organic Waste; (vi) The Baku Global Climate Transparency Platform (BTP) – Baku Declaration on Global Climate Transparency; (vii) COP29 Declaration on Water for Climate Action; (viii) The Baku Harmoniya Climate Initiative for Farmers; and (ix) COP29 Declaration on Enhanced Action in Tourism.

Singapore will not be claiming from the Loss and Damage Fund and is committed to doing our part to support fellow developing countries.

We also provide technical assistance and human resource capacity building to climate-related areas through the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP). For instance, under the ambit of the SCP, we have established a Small Island Developing States Technical Cooperation Programme that caters to the specific needs of small island developing states, including climate-related issues and challenges. The SCP training courses cover a wide range of topics including sustainable urban development, water management and energy efficiency and emissions reduction.

Singapore actively collaborates with countries around the world, to build on one another's strengths and experiences in climate change, and to provide training to developing countries on climate change and environment-related issues. These countries include Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.

To further strengthen our effort in global collaboration, we have commenced negotiations on a bilateral Green Economy Agreement (GEA) with Australia, which will be a world-first agreement that combines trade, economic and environment objectives. Singapore has also concluded Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with other international partners like Chile and Japan on low-emissions solutions.

These initiatives reflect our commitment to sharing our knowledge, experience, and expertise to help developing countries implement sustainable environmental and climate policies and practices. Under the Singapore Cooperation Programme, our flagship technical assistance programme, and its Climate Action Package, we have trained close to 150,000 officials from over 180 countries and territories in topics such as climate adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk management, and green finance.

**C40**

Singapore joined the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) as an observer city in March 2012. The C40 is a network of about 100 global cities (including Berlin, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Johannesburg, Los Angeles, London, New York, Sao Paulo, Seoul and Tokyo) committed to implementing meaningful and sustainable climate-related actions locally that will address global climate change. It collaborates with several international organisations such as the World Bank, OECD, the Clinton Climate Initiative and the World Resources Institute, on initiatives that advance urban action on climate change solutions.

Our participation with the C40 has allowed us to learn from the best practices of other C40 cities in areas such as building energy efficiency, transportation, climate change resilience and adaptation. Singapore has also contributed to C40 by sharing our experiences in urban development and transport infrastructure.

Singapore’s efforts in promoting urban sustainability and addressing climate change were also recognised by C40 in 2013 when it was presented with the C40 &amp; Siemens City Climate Leadership Award.
