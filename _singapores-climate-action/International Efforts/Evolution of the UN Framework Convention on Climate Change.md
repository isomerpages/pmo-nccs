### Evolution of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
**1990**

IPCC's First Assessment Report underscored the seriousness of climate
change and linked emissions from human activities to the warming of the
earth's surface beyond natural effects.

**1992**

The draft of the Framework Convention deliberated at the UN Conference
on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro. The preparatory
committee of UNCED and the Main Committee of the Rio meeting was chaired
by Singapore's Ambassador-at-Large Tommy Koh. It led to the landmark UNFCCC
adopted by the United Nations. The framework required governments to develop
policies and strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within their
national boundaries and adapt to irreversible climate change.<p></p>
<p>The Convention on Climate Change enjoyed near universal membership, making
it one of the most globally supported international agreements under the
UN.</p>
<p><strong>1997</strong>
</p>
<p>The Kyoto Protocol attendees negotiated with 41 developed countries (Annex
I Parties) agreeing to binding targets for emissions reductions from 2008
to 2012.</p>
<p><strong>2005</strong>
</p>
<p><a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/what-is-the-kyoto-protocol/kyoto-protocol-targets-for-the-first-commitment-period" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Kyoto Protocol</a> came
into effect.</p>
<p><strong>2007</strong>
</p>
<p>Bali Road Map established a new negotiating track to finalise a binding
climate agreement involving all parties.</p>
<p><strong>2009</strong>
</p>
<p>Copenhagen Climate Conference did not reach consensus, but a number of
developed and developing countries announced targets on emission reduction
efforts up to 2020.</p>
<p><strong>2010</strong>
</p>
<p>Cancun Agreements formalised the reduction pledges and adopted decisions
on mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and REDD+ (Reducing Emissions
from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus).</p>
<p><strong>2011</strong>
</p>
<p>The Durban Platform set out an agreement on a second commitment period
of the Kyoto Protocol. There was also agreement to launch negotiations
on a new, legally binding, global agreement that would apply to all countries,
and come into effect in 2020. The Durban conference also agreed on a package
of key decisions, including the setting up of a Green Climate Fund to channel
climate-related finance resources for developing countries to reduce emissions
and to adapt to climate change.</p>
<p><strong>2012</strong>
</p>
<p>At the UN Climate Change Conference in Doha, Parties agreed to a new commitment
period of eight years under the Kyoto Protocol, agreed a firm timetable
to adopt a universal climate agreement by 2015 and agreed a path to raise
necessary ambition to respond to climate change. They also endorsed the
completion of new institutions and agreed ways and means to deliver scaled-up
climate finance and technology to developing countries.</p>
<p><strong>2013</strong>
</p>
<p>In Warsaw, Poland, the Parties produced a set of decisions including a
rulebook for <a href="https://redd.unfccc.int/" class="Hyperlink SCXW209161515 BCX0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation</u></a> and
a mechanism to address <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/workstreams/approaches-to-address-loss-and-damage-associated-with-climate-change-impacts-in-developing-countries" class="Hyperlink SCXW209161515 BCX0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>loss and damage</u></a> caused
by long-term climate change impacts. They also agreed to communicate their
respective contributions towards the global climate agreement well in advance
of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP-21) in Paris in
2015.</p>
<p><strong>2014</strong>
</p>
<p>In Lima, Peru, the Parties agreed on various ground rules to guide the
submission of their respective contributions towards the global climate
agreement. Pledges made by both developed and developing countries prior
to and during the COP-20 also took the capitalisation of the new Green
Climate Fund past an initial $10 billion target.</p>
<p><strong>2015</strong>
</p>
<p>On 12 December 2015 at the COP-21 in Paris, 196 Parties adopted a new
climate agreement applicable to all Parties. The Paris Agreement, which
will take effect post-2020, aims to hold the increase in global average
temperature to well below 2°C, and pursue efforts to limit the temperature
increase to 1.5°C.</p>
<p><strong>2018</strong>
</p>
<p>Following three years of negotiations, the Parties adopted the Katowice
Climate Package, which comprise a set of guidelines and procedures relating
to the implementation of the Paris Agreement in Katowice, Poland. The conclusion
of the Katowice Climate Package marks a major milestone to operationalise
the Paris Agreement and reinforces the role of the UNFCCC in the multilateral
system for global climate action.</p>
<p><strong>2021</strong>
</p>
<p>In November 2021, the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP-26) to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Glasgow laid
a firm foundation, and accelerated the momentum for global climate action.
As part of a substantive and balanced package of decisions, known as the
Glasgow Climate Pact, Parties agreed to revisit their 2030 climate pledges,
or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), and communicate Long-term
Low Emissions Development Strategies (LEDS) towards net zero emissions,
to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal.</p>
<p>At COP-26, Singapore, together with Norway, co-facilitated negotiations
that brought the Article 6 rulebook across the finishing line, after six
years of protracted talks. Article 6, which governs market and non-market
cooperative mechanisms towards emission reduction, was the sole outstanding
issue under the Paris Agreement Work Programme.</p>
<p>The agreement on Article 6 clears the path for the establishment of mechanisms
that facilitate the transfer of emission reductions, or carbon credits,
between countries to meet their NDC, while ensuring high standards of environmental
integrity.</p>
<p><strong>2023</strong>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>At COP-28, Singapore and Norway co-facilitated ministerial consultations
on mitigation to raise global climate action and accelerate the energy
transition in this decade. Singapore also co-chaired the first Global Stocktake
(GST) which reviewed the collective progress towards achieving the goals
of the Paris Agreement. &nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Singapore announced various initiatives to support and accelerate a green
transition in Singapore, our region, and beyond, including the <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2023/getting-transition-finance-right" class="Hyperlink SCXW130847801 BCX0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FAST-P (Financing Asia’s Transition Partnership)</a> blended

<p>Singapore organised the COP28 Singapore Pavilion, showcasing Singapore’s
climate solutions, innovations and partnerships to accelerate collective
climate action.<strong> </strong>Singapore sent our first official youth
delegation to COP28, with youth delegates identified from the Climate Youth
Development Programme.</p>
