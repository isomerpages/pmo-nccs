### Evolution of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
**1990**

IPCC's First Assessment Report underscored the seriousness of climate change and linked emissions from human activities to the warming of the earth's surface beyond natural effects.

**1992**

The draft of the Framework Convention deliberated at the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro. The preparatory committee of UNCED and the Main Committee of the Rio meeting was chaired by Singapore's Ambassador-at-Large Tommy Koh. It led to the landmark UNFCCC adopted by the United Nations. The framework required governments to develop policies and strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within their national boundaries and adapt to irreversible climate change.

The Convention on Climate Change enjoyed near universal membership, making it one of the most globally supported international agreements under the UN.

**1997**

The Kyoto Protocol attendees negotiated with 41 developed countries (Annex I Parties) agreeing to binding targets for emissions reductions from 2008 to 2012.

**2005**

[Kyoto Protocol](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-kyoto-protocol/what-is-the-kyoto-protocol/kyoto-protocol-targets-for-the-first-commitment-period) came into effect.

**2007**

Bali Road Map established a new negotiating track to finalise a binding climate agreement involving all parties.

**2009**

Copenhagen Climate Conference did not reach consensus, but a number of developed and developing countries announced targets on emission reduction efforts up to 2020.

**2010**

Cancun Agreements formalised the reduction pledges and adopted decisions on mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus).

**2011**

The Durban Platform set out an agreement on a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. There was also agreement to launch negotiations on a new, legally binding, global agreement that would apply to all countries, and come into effect in 2020. The Durban conference also agreed on a package of key decisions, including the setting up of a Green Climate Fund to channel climate-related finance resources for developing countries to reduce emissions and to adapt to climate change.

**2012**

At the UN Climate Change Conference in Doha, Parties agreed to a new commitment period of eight years under the Kyoto Protocol, agreed a firm timetable to adopt a universal climate agreement by 2015 and agreed a path to raise necessary ambition to respond to climate change. They also endorsed the completion of new institutions and agreed ways and means to deliver scaled-up climate finance and technology to developing countries.

**2013**

In Warsaw, Poland, the Parties produced a set of decisions including a rulebook for [reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation](https://redd.unfccc.int/) and a mechanism to address [loss and damage](https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/workstreams/approaches-to-address-loss-and-damage-associated-with-climate-change-impacts-in-developing-countries) caused by long-term climate change impacts. They also agreed to communicate their respective contributions towards the global climate agreement well in advance of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP-21) in Paris in 2015.

**2014**

In Lima, Peru, the Parties agreed on various ground rules to guide the submission of their respective contributions towards the global climate agreement. Pledges made by both developed and developing countries prior to and during the COP-20 also took the capitalisation of the new Green Climate Fund past an initial $10 billion target.

**2015**

On 12 December 2015 at the COP-21 in Paris, 196 Parties adopted a new climate agreement applicable to all Parties. The Paris Agreement, which will take effect post-2020, aims to hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C, and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C.

**2018**

Following three years of negotiations, the Parties adopted the Katowice Climate Package, which comprise a set of guidelines and procedures relating to the implementation of the Paris Agreement in Katowice, Poland. The conclusion of the Katowice Climate Package marks a major milestone to operationalise the Paris Agreement and reinforces the role of the UNFCCC in the multilateral system for global climate action.

**2021**

In November 2021, the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP-26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Glasgow laid a firm foundation, and accelerated the momentum for global climate action. As part of a substantive and balanced package of decisions, known as the Glasgow Climate Pact, Parties agreed to revisit their 2030 climate pledges, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), and communicate Long-term Low Emissions Development Strategies (LEDS) towards net zero emissions, to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal.

At COP-26, Singapore, together with Norway, co-facilitated negotiations that brought the Article 6 rulebook across the finishing line, after six years of protracted talks. Article 6, which governs market and non-market cooperative mechanisms towards emission reduction, was the sole outstanding issue under the Paris Agreement Work Programme.

The agreement on Article 6 clears the path for the establishment of mechanisms that facilitate the transfer of emission reductions, or carbon credits, between countries to meet their NDC, while ensuring high standards of environmental integrity.

**2023**

At COP-28, Singapore and Norway co-facilitated ministerial consultations on mitigation to raise global climate action and accelerate the energy transition in this decade. Singapore also co-chaired the first Global Stocktake (GST) which reviewed the collective progress towards achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. 

Singapore announced various initiatives to support and accelerate a green
transition in Singapore, our region, and beyond, including the [FAST-P (Financing Asia’s Transition Partnership)](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2023/getting-transition-finance-right) blended finance initiative, the [Singapore-Asia Taxonomy](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-launches-worlds-first-multi-sector-transition-taxonomy) and the [Transition Credits Coalition (TRACTION)](https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-launches-traction-and-announces-pilots-to-develop-transition-credits)

Singapore organised the COP28 Singapore Pavilion, showcasing Singapore’s climate solutions, innovations and partnerships to accelerate collective climate action. Singapore sent our first official youth delegation to COP28, with youth delegates identified from the climate youth development programme.
