### WHAT WE CAN DO

As an individual, employee, member of a family or member of the wider community, you have a stake in helping to reduce our emissions and in preparing for the effects of climate change.

[<a href="/singapores-climate-action/for-individuals/" target="_blank">For Individuals</a>](/singapores-climate-action/for-individuals/) and [<a href="/singapores-climate-action/for-organisations/" target="_blank">For organisations</a>](/singapores-climate-action/for-organisations/) can play their part by making simple lifestyle adjustments or changes to business processes.

Over the years, Singapore has spared no effort in our mission for sustainable development. 

From designating 2018 as the [<a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2018-12-14-newsletter-year-of-climate-action-key-initiatives/" target="_blank">Year of Climate Action</a>](https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2018-12-14-newsletter-year-of-climate-action-key-initiatives/) to the annual [<a href="https://mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-08-14-press-release-on-singapore-climate-action-week/" target="_blank">Climate Action Week</a>](https://mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-08-14-press-release-on-singapore-climate-action-week/), the government has made significant efforts to rally for collective action. In 2019, the [<a href="https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-09-26-speech-on-reducing-excessive-consumption-of-disposables/" target="_blank">#RecycleRight Citizens’ Workgroup</a>](https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2020-09-26-speech-on-reducing-excessive-consumption-of-disposables/) was convened to look at how to improve household recycling In 2020, the [<a href="https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2020/11/EST-Press-Release---19-Nov-2020.pdf" target="_blank">Alliances for Action</a>](https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2020/11/EST-Press-Release---19-Nov-2020.pdf), as well as conversations on sustainability to [<a href="https://emergingstronger.sg/" target="_blank">emerge stronger</a>](https://emergingstronger.sg/) together with citizens, businesses, and [<a href="https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/green-groups-in-singapore/" target="_blank">NGOs</a>](https://www.towardszerowaste.gov.sg/green-groups-in-singapore/) were started.

In Feb 2021, the government has put together a ten-year plan called the Singapore Green Plan 2030. The Green Plan is a whole-of-nation sustainable development agenda, with firm action plans, touching on almost every dimension of our lives.
