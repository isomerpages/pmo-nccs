### GREEN ICT

With a vibrant and thriving green information and communication technologies (ICT) industry comprising more than 80 of the top 100 software and services companies in the world, Singapore is at the forefront of green ICT development. The Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) routinely works with industry partners and companies to advance Singapore's position within the ICT industry. This makes us the perfect location for companies looking to develop and test bed new solutions.

IDA has established the **Green Data Centre Innovation Programme (GDCIP)** to support high impact research, development and demonstration (RD&D) in data centre efficiency in Singapore. It consists of three initiatives:

* The **Research Programme** provides funding to research entities to improve green data centre technologies, and translate them into actual products or solutions that can be adopted to produce positive economic impact in the data centre industry.  
* The **Innovation Programme** focuses on driving the prototyping, integration and demonstration of technologies. This is done by inviting companies to form a consortium to develop and pilot innovative solutions that will significantly improve the energy efficiency of local data centres.  
* The **Hub Programme complements** the research and innovation programmes by establishing Singapore's first Green Data Centre Hub. It will be a test-bed that mirrors a data centre environment, to prototype, develop, demonstrate and benchmark energy efficient data centre technologies.

A tax incentive was introduced in 2012 to encourage data centre operators to be more energy efficient. Under the Investment Allowance Scheme for Energy Efficiency Projects (Data Centres), eligible companies will be granted an investment allowance to offset 30 per cent to 50 per cent of the fixed capital expenditure incurred in implementing energy efficiency retrofits for their data centres.
