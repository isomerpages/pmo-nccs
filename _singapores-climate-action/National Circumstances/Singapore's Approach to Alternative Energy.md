<h3>SINGAPORE'S APPROACH TO ALTERNATIVE ENERGY</h3>
<p>As a small, resource-constrained country, Singapore imports almost all
its energy needs, and has limited renewable energy options:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Commercial wind turbines operate at wind speeds of around above 4.5m/s
but the average wind speed in Singapore is only about 2m/s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singapore's relatively narrow tidal range and calm seas limit opportunities
for commercial tidal power generation. Much of our sea space is also used
for ports, anchorage and shipping lanes, which limit the application of
ocean energy technologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hydroelectric power cannot be harnessed, as Singapore does not have a
river system with fast flowing water throughout the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our small physical size (735.7 km<sup>2</sup>), high population density
and land scarcity limits our potential for sustainably-grown domestic biomass.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Singapore's high average annual solar irradiation of about 1,580 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> makes
solar photovoltaic (PV) a potential renewable energy option for Singapore.
However, we face challenges to the use of solar energy in Singapore. We
have limited available land for the large scale deployment of solar panels.
In addition, the presence of high cloud cover across Singapore and urban
shading poses challenges such as intermittency.</p>
<p>With the limited renewable energy options available to us and the current
technological capabilities, we are not able to generate sufficient baseload
electricity from renewable sources reliably for Singapore. Nevertheless,
Singapore aims to deploy at least 2 gigawatt-peak of solar energy by 2030.
This is equivalent to powering about 350,000 households for a year.</p>
<p>Singapore is investing in research and development as well as test-bedding
to improve the performance of solar PV systems and develop innovative ways
of integrating solar energy systems into our urban environment. Some of
our test-bedding projects include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/solarnova-page" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Housing &amp; Development Board's initiative</a> to
install solar panels on rooftops of high-rise public housing developments,
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.pub.gov.sg/Public/WaterLoop/Sustainability/Solar/Floating" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PUB's floating PV projects</a>,
which have installed solar panels on water surfaces at our reservoirs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Singapore's focus on research and test-bedding is to improve the performance
of solar systems and develop innovative ways of integrating solar energy
systems into our urban environment.</p>
<p>As part of our efforts to continually explore new options for energy supply
and enhance our energy security, Singapore is exploring a variety of different
options, including regional power grids, and emerging low-carbon alternatives
such as low-carbon hydrogen. In addition, Singapore is also studying the
potential development of advanced nuclear technologies in Singapore's context.
Any decision to develop new energies requires consideration and demonstration
of their safety, reliability, affordability and environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>With new developments in geothermal technology, there is potential to
harness heat that is deep underground for power generation. However, these
advanced geothermal technologies that can harness heat at great depths
have yet to be commercially deployed. The Energy Market Authority is conducting
a study to assess how Singapore can harness geothermal energy for power
generation.</p>
