<h3>IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN SINGAPORE</h3>
<p>Singapore is not insulated from the impact of climate change. From 1984
to 2022, the annual mean temperature rose by 0.24°C per decade. 2024 was
also one of Singapore's warmest years on record, tied with 2019 and 2016.
The mean sea level in Singapore is also projected to rise by 0.23m to 1.15m
by the end of the century.</p>
<p>Rainfall has also increased in recent years. Annual rainfall total for
Singapore has been gradually increasing at a rate of 83 mm per decade from
1980 to 2022. Singapore's total rainfall in 2024 was 8.1% higher than the
long-term annual average.</p>
<h3>How Can Climate Change Affect Singapore?</h3>
<p><strong>Sea level rise</strong>
</p>
<p>As a low-lying island, the rise in sea level poses the most immediate
threat to Singapore. Much of our nation lies only 15 m above the Singapore
Height Datum<sup>1</sup>, with about 30 per cent of our island being less
than 5 m above the Singapore Height Datum.</p>
<p><sup>1 Singapore Height Datum is the reference established based on the mean sea level determined at the tide gauge located at Victoria Dock in Tanjong Pagar between 1935-1937. It is used for height measurement in engineering and mapping activities.</sup>
</p>
<p><strong>Water resources</strong>
</p>
<p>An increase in the intensity of weather variability could present significant
challenges to the management of our water resources. Periods of drought
can affect the reliability of Singapore's water supply, while sudden episodes
of intense rainfall could overwhelm our drainage system and lead to flash
floods.</p>
<p><strong>Biodiversity and greenery</strong>
</p>
<p>A mean temperature increase of 1.5°C to 2.5°C could affect the natural
diversity of Singapore's plants and animals at risk, as this alters our
ecosystem’s natural processes such as soil formation, nutrient storage
and pollution absorption.</p>
<p><strong>Effect on public health</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore is situated in a region where vector-borne diseases are endemic.
Most cases of vector-borne diseases like dengue are observed during warmer
periods of the year. In addition, frequent and severe instances of warm
weather may lead to increased incidence of heat-related injuries, which
puts children and the elderly at greater risk.</p>

<p><em>A warmer climate creates heat stress and discomfort, with the elderly most at risk.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Rising Temperatures</strong>
</p>
<p>Rising temperatures will negatively affect urban areas, which already
tend to be warmer due to the replacement of natural land cover with buildings
and other infrastructure that retain or produce heat. Higher temperatures
can also lead to thermal discomfort, which may require greater use of air-conditioning,
increasing Singapore’s energy demands. This in turn results in higher domestic
carbon emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Food security</strong>
</p>
<p>The effects of climate change, such as intense storms, flooding and prolonged
droughts, are one of the trends threatening global food security. In Singapore,
we are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in global food supply and
prices, as we import more than 90 per cent of our food.</p>

<p><em>A small increase in global temperature can cause changes in weather patterns that will disrupt crops grown in other countries, and eventually our food supply.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>National Climate Change Study</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore has undertaken three National Climate Change Studies over the
past decade to better understand the potential impact of climate change
on the country.</p>
<p>The findings of the latest study, the Third National Climate Change Study
(V3), was released by Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) in January
2024. V3 projects higher temperatures, more wet and dry extremes, and accelerating
increase in mean sea levels for Singapore and Southeast Asia by the end
of the century. This is consistent with the findings of the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Working Group I Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)</a>.
The updated climate projections will enable the Singapore Government to
review and refine our climate adaptation plans to ensure that Singapore
remains resilient to the impact of climate change. Detailed results can
be found in <a href="https://www.mss-int.sg/v3-climate-projections/resources/v3-reports" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">V3 Stakeholder and Technical Reports</a> and
