### IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN SINGAPORE

Singapore is not insulated from the impact of climate change. From 1984 to 2022, the annual mean temperature rose by 0.24°C per decade. 2024 was also one of Singapore's warmest years on record, tied with 2019 and 2016. The mean sea level in Singapore is also projected to rise by 0.23m to 1.15m by the end of the century.

Rainfall has also increased in recent years. Annual rainfall total for Singapore has been gradually increasing at a rate of 83 mm per decade from 1980 to 2022. Singapore's total rainfall in 2024 was 8.1% higher than the long-term annual average.

### How Can Climate Change Affect Singapore?

**Sea level rise**

As a low-lying island, the rise in sea level poses the most immediate threat to Singapore. Much of our nation lies only 15 m above the Singapore Height Datum<sup>1</sup>, with about 30 per cent of our island being less than 5 m above the Singapore Height Datum.

<sup id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Singapore Height Datum is the reference established based on the mean sea level determined at the tide gauge located at Victoria Dock in Tanjong Pagar between 1935-1937. It is used for height measurement in engineering and mapping activities.

**Water resources**

An increase in the intensity of weather variability could present significant challenges to the management of our water resources. Periods of drought can affect the reliability of Singapore's water supply, while sudden episodes of intense rainfall could overwhelm our drainage system and lead to flash floods.

**Biodiversity and greenery**

A mean temperature increase of 1.5°C to 2.5°C could affect the natural diversity of Singapore's plants and animals at risk, as this alters our ecosystem’s natural processes such as soil formation, nutrient storage and pollution absorption. 

**Effect on public health**

Singapore is situated in a region where vector-borne diseases are endemic. Most cases of vector-borne diseases like dengue are observed during warmer periods of the year. In addition, frequent and severe instances of warm weather may lead to increased incidence of heat-related injuries, which puts children and the elderly at greater risk.

**Rising Temperatures**

Rising temperatures will negatively affect urban areas, which already tend to be warmer due to the replacement of natural land cover with buildings and other infrastructure that retain or produce heat. Higher temperatures can also lead to thermal discomfort, which may require greater use of air-conditioning, increasing Singapore’s energy demands. This in turn results in higher domestic carbon emissions.

**Food security**

The effects of climate change, such as intense storms, flooding and prolonged droughts, are one of the trends threatening global food security. In Singapore, we are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in global food supply and prices, as we import more than 90 per cent of our food.

**National Climate Change Study**

Singapore has undertaken three National Climate Change Studies over the past decade to better understand the potential impact of climate change on the country. 

The findings of the latest study, the Third National Climate Change Study (V3), was released by Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) in January 2024. V3 projects higher temperatures, more wet and dry extremes, and accelerating increase in mean sea levels for Singapore and Southeast Asia by the end of the century. This is consistent with the findings of the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Working Group I Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/). The updated climate projections will enable the Singapore Government to review and refine our climate adaptation plans to ensure that Singapore remains resilient to the impact of climate change. Detailed results can be found in [V3 Stakeholder and Technical Reports](https://www.mss-int.sg/v3-climate-projections/resources/v3-reports) and [V3 data visualisation portal](http://www.mss-int.sg/V3-climate-projections).
