### INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION

Given our [national circumstances](/singapores-climate-action/overview/national-circumstances), Singapore is highly dependent on effective international cooperation to achieve our decarbonisation goals. While we continue to prioritise domestic efforts to reduce emissions, we will need to pursue bilateral, regional, plurilateral, and multilateral collaboration to access regional and global mitigation opportunities.

This is why Singapore actively fosters effective international cooperation on climate action. Singapore has played an active role to support the multilateral framework of cooperation on climate change under the UNFCCC, including co-facilitating the negotiations at COP-26 that finalised the Article 6 rulebook of the Paris Agreement.

As an advocate of close bilateral, regional and plurilateral cooperation; Singapore has signed agreements with various partners to strengthen collaboration on carbon markets, green finance and low-carbon technologies. Singapore is committed to advancing global climate action through international collaboration with like-minded partners.

**Collaboration on Carbon Markets**

Singapore is committed to ensuring the integrity, quality and transparency of carbon markets. This includes robust and independent accounting, and the avoidance of double counting, and requiring corresponding adjustments.

To advance the generation and sharing of carbon credits to support Singapore and other partner countries’ climate ambitions, Singapore has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with countries such as Cambodia, Chile, Mongolia and Rwanda on carbon credits collaboration aligned to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. These collaborations will also prioritise sustainable development and co-benefits to the local communities and economy.

Under these MOUs, Singapore and partner countries will work towards a legally binding Implementation Agreement that sets out a bilateral framework for the international transfer of correspondingly adjusted mitigation outcomes, and identifies potential Article 6-compliant mitigation activities which can support both countries to achieve their respective NDCs. Singapore has since substantively concluded the negotiation of the Implementation Agreement with Bhutan, Ghana, Paraguay and Vietnam. At COP-28 in December 2023, Singapore signed our first Implementation Agreement with Papua New Guinea.

**Collaboration on Low-Carbon Solutions**

On the energy front, enhancing regional energy connectivity, including through the ASEAN Power Grid, is one initiative that can enhance economic development, energy security and sustainability in the region. 

As a pathfinder to the ASEAN Power Grid, Singapore has begun importing renewable hydropower from the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), using existing interconnections via Thailand and Malaysia, as part of the [Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP)](https://www.ema.gov.sg/news-events/news/media-releases/2022/singapore-commences-first-renewable-energy-electricity-import-via-regional-multilateral-power-trade). Our aim is to import up to 4 GW of low-carbon electricity from beyond our shores by 2035, which is expected to make up around 30% for Singapore’s total supply. In addition to working with our regional neighbours on the LTMS-PIP, Singapore has signed bilateral MOUs with countries like Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, Chile, Indonesia, Japan, Lao PDR, New Zealand, and Vietnam, to collaborate on areas including regional power grids and low-carbon solutions.

To further develop and refine our technical and regulatory frameworks for large-scale electricity imports, Singapore has also announced two small-scale trial imports of electricity: [100 MW from Peninsular Malaysia and 100 MW from a solar farm in Pulau Bulan, Indonesia](https://www.ema.gov.sg/electricity-imports.aspx).
