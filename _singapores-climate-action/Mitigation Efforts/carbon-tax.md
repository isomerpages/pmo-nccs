### CARBON TAX

Singapore implemented a carbon tax, the first carbon pricing scheme in Southeast Asia, on 1 January 2019. 

The carbon tax level is set at S$5/tCO<sub>2</sub>e in the first instance from 2019 to 2023, to provide a transitional period to give emitters time to adjust. The carbon tax applies to direct emissions from facilities emitting at least 25 ktCO<sub>2</sub>e per year, covering (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). About 50 facilities are subject to the carbon tax, covering around 80% of Singapore’s total emissions. Taking into account fuel excise duties which have priced in environmental externalities, more than 90% of our emissions are subject to a carbon price. This coverage is one of the highest in the world. 

The carbon tax provides a broad-based price signal to encourage companies to reduce their emissions, yet gives them the flexibility to take action where it makes the most economic sense. The carbon tax forms part of Singapore’s comprehensive suite of mitigation measures to reduce emissions, create green growth opportunities, and transition to an energy-efficient low-carbon economy. To maintain a transparent, fair, and consistent price signal across the economy, the carbon tax is applied uniformly to all sectors including energy-intensive and trade-exposed sectors, without exemption.

Since the announcement of the carbon tax level in Budget 2018, we have enhanced our 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and submitted our 2050 Long-term Low Emissions Development Strategy under the Paris Agreement in March 2020.

 Internationally, rising international momentum has also been demonstrated by the adoption of the Glasgow Climate Pact at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP-26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in November 2021 which seeks to keep the 1.5°C temperature goal alive. Parties had agreed to revisit their 2030 NDCs by the end of 2022 to achieve greater alignment with the Paris Agreement temperature goals, and submit Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) that commit to net zero emissions “by or around mid-century”. As a responsible member of the international community, Singapore will also do our part to fulfil our international obligations. We will review our targets and raise our climate ambition, ensure that our targets are backed by the right strategies, policies, and actions.
  
In anticipation of the rising global climate ambition and momentum amidst the greater urgency of climate issues, Deputy Prime Minister Mr Heng Swee Keat, who was then Minister for Finance, announced at [Budget 2021](https://www.mof.gov.sg/singaporebudget/budget-2021/budget-speech/e-building-a-sustainable-home-for-all#Singapore-Green-Plan-2030) that Singapore would review our post-2023 carbon tax level and trajectory, in consultation with industry and expert groups, as the current carbon tax level is too low. With an appropriate carbon tax level, we can expect to accelerate our low-carbon transition, promote industry innovation and green growth, while maintaining Singapore’s overall economic competitiveness. This was also reiterated by the Minister for Finance, Mr Lawrence Wong at the 35th Singapore Economic Roundtable by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS).
  
The Government will announce the outcome of the review at Budget 2022, to provide time for businesses to adjust to any revision in the carbon tax trajectory.
