### Household

Singapore has taken steps to [reduce energy consumption of the household sector](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency/household-sector/), which accounts for about 15% of our total electricity consumption. The Minimum Energy Performance Standards — which have been progressively tightened over the years — raise the energy efficiency of household appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners, clothes dryers and lamps. To help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions, the Government has also progressively expanded the Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme to cover an increasing variety of appliances.

Singapore will continue to provide support to households impacted by the low-carbon transition, through initiatives such as the [Climate Friendly Household Programme](https://www.climate-friendly-households.gov.sg) to defray the costs of switching to more resource-efficient and climate-friendly appliances for lower-income households.
