### Transport

Sustainability is intrinsic to the design of Singapore’s Land Transport system, which accounts for about 15% of carbon emissions in Singapore.

**Making Walk-Cycle-Ride the Preferred Mode to Travel**

The [Land Transport Master Plan 2040](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/who_we_are/our_work/land_transport_master_plan_2040.html) highlights our plan to reduce the land transport
sector’s carbon footprint. A significant needle-mover to reduce emissions is to go car-lite by encouraging the use of Walk-Cycle-Ride modes of transport.

Singapore is taking further steps to green our public transport operations, and targets to raise the mass public transport modal share during peak hour to 75 per cent by 2030. We will continue to improve the connectivity and sustain the reliability of our rail network, including to expand [our MRT network](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/upcoming_projects.html#:~:text=Rail%20Expansion-,Rail%20Expansion,minutes%20of%20a%20train%20station.) to 360km by the 2030s. Since 2020, all [new public bus purchases](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/who_we_are/our_work/public_transport_system/bus/upgrading_bus_fleets.html) are cleaner energy buses, including electric or hybrid buses. Singapore aims
to gradually replace all existing diesel buses with cleaner energy buses by 2040, so that the public can enjoy quieter commutes and cleaner air.

We are also working towards building a liveable and sustainable city where walking and cycling become more common commuting choices. To encourage Active Mobility, we will expand the cycling path network to around 1,300km islandwide by 2030 under the
[Islandwide Cycling Network Programme](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/getting_around/active_mobility/walking_cycling_infrastructure/cycling.html). We will also repurpose suitable stretches of road
into wider footpaths, cycling paths, or bus lanes, to better support cycling and walking.

**Promoting Cleaner Energy Vehicles**

Singapore aims to have all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040. To support the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), Singapore has adopted a three-pronged approach:

* **Vehicle Taxes and Incentives.** Singapore has implemented a range of measures such as the EV Early Adoption Incentive, Vehicular Emissions Scheme, Additional Registration Fee (ARF) floor reduction, and the revision of road tax framework for electric cars.

* **Regulations and Standards.** The Land Transport Authority (LTA) promotes and regulates the safe use of EVs and EV charging. Our national EV charging standard,
Technical Reference 25 (TR25), is periodically reviewed by representatives from industry, academia and government agencies to ensure that it remains aligned to
industry best practices.

* **EV Charger Deployment.** Singapore aims to deploy 60,000 electric vehicle EV charging points nationwide by 2030, comprising 40,000 in public car parks and 20,000 in private premises. Every HDB town will be EV-ready by 2025, with around 2,000 HDB carparks to be fitted with EV charging points.

We are also enhancing existing transport facilities to make them more environmentally friendly, and designing and building new land transport, airport and port facilities that are sustainable and green, by incorporating energy efficient and carbon mitigation features and
technologies.
