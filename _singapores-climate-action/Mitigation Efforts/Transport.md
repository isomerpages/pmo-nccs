### Transport

Singapore has one of the most comprehensive and innovative systems in the world for managing vehicle ownership and usage. Since 2018, we have kept our private vehicle population growth at zero. As part of the [LTMP 2040](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/who_we_are/our_work/land_transport_master_plan_2040.html), the Government aims to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles and have all vehicles running on cleaner energy by 2040. The LTMP also aims to have 9 in 10 peak period WCR journeys to be completed in less than 45 minutes by 2040. We have invested and will continue to invest significantly in our public transport and active mobility infrastructure to encourage Walk-Cycle-Ride (WCR) modes of travel. To encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), we have various incentives to lower the upfront and running costs of an EV. All newly registered vehicles will be cleaner-energy models starting from 2030. We are also expanding our public EV charging infrastructure, with a target of 60,000 charging points nationwide by 2030.

The Government is also enhancing existing transport facilities to make them more environmentally friendly, and designing and building new land transport, airport and port facilities that are sustainable and green, through incorporating energy efficient and carbon mitigation features and technologies.
