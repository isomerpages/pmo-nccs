### Carbon Tax

As Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong announced at the Singapore International Energy Week 2022, Singapore will raise our climate ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Singapore’s carbon tax underpins our net zero ambition and climate mitigation efforts by providing an effective economic signal to steer producers and consumers away from carbon-intensive goods and services, hold businesses accountable for their emissions, and enhance the business case for the development of low-carbon solutions. The carbon tax forms part of Singapore’s comprehensive suite of mitigation measures to support the transition to a low-carbon economy.

**Carbon Tax in Singapore from 2019 – 2023**

Singapore implemented a carbon tax, the first carbon pricing scheme in Southeast Asia, on 1 January 2019. The carbon tax level was set at S$5/tCO<sub>2</sub>e for the first five years from 2019 to 2023, to provide a transitional period for emitters to adjust.

**Key Updates to Carbon Tax Post-2023 (Effective from 1 January 2024)**

To support our net zero ambition, **the carbon tax will be raised to S$25/tCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2024 and 2025, and S$45/tCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2026 and 2027, with a view to reaching S$50-80/tCO<sub>2</sub>e by 2030**. This will strengthen the price signal and impetus for businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint in line with national climate goals.

The revised carbon tax trajectory is critical in enabling the pace of transformation needed to achieve our raised climate ambition and make the economy- and society-wide transition to a low-carbon future. It also helps businesses remain competitive in a low-carbon future, by enhancing the business case to invest in low-carbon solutions, and ensuring that new investments and economic activities are aligned with our national climate goals.

The Government does not expect to derive additional revenue from the carbon tax increase in this decade. The revenue will be used to support decarbonisation efforts and the transition to a green economy, and cushion the impact on businesses and households.

**Use of International Carbon Credits**

Companies may use high quality international carbon credits to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions from 2024. This will cushion the impact for companies that are able to source for credible carbon credits in a cost-effective manner, help to create local demand for high-quality carbon credits, and catalyse the development of well-functioning and regulated carbon markets. All international carbon credits used under the carbon tax regime will need to adhere to a set of eligibility criteria, to ensure that they are of high environmental integrity and compliant with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

**Transition Framework**

A transition framework will also be introduced to provide support for existing emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) companies as they work to reduce emissions and invest in cleaner technologies, and to manage the near-term impact on business competitiveness. The framework will also help to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage. To drive our industry towards becoming best-in-class, the amount of allowances awarded to each facility will be determined based on their performance on internationally-recognised efficiency benchmarks where available, or facilities’ decarbonisation plans. These transitory allowances are limited to only a portion of companies’ emissions, and the amount awarded to eligible facilities will also be reviewed regularly. Similar frameworks have been implemented in other jurisdictions with carbon pricing schemes, including the EU, South Korea, and California. [\[JWH(2\]](#_msocom_2) 

Consultations with affected companies on the support measures and transition framework are currently ongoing, and will be finalised by 1H 2023, ahead of the implementation of the revised carbon tax framework in 2024.[\[JWH(3\]](#_msocom_3) 

**Updates to list of GHGs and associated GWP values**

The list of GHGs and their Global Warming Potential (GWP) values will be updated in line with newer standards adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or IPCC.

The carbon tax coverage will also be expanded to include Nitrogen Trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>), the seventh GHG, from 2024 onwards.
