<h3>CARBON TAX</h3>
<p>Singapore’s carbon tax underpins our net zero targets and climate mitigation
efforts by providing an effective economic signal to steer producers and
consumers away from carbon-intensive goods and services, hold businesses
accountable for their emissions, and enhance the business case for the
development of low-carbon solutions. In all, the carbon tax currently covers
80% of our total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from about 50 facilities
in the manufacturing, power, waste, and water sectors. The carbon tax forms
part of Singapore’s comprehensive suite of mitigation measures to support
the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon Tax in Singapore from 2019 to 2023</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore implemented a carbon tax, the first carbon pricing scheme in
Southeast Asia, on 1 January 2019. The carbon tax level was set at S$5/tCO<sub>2</sub>e
for the first five years from 2019 to 2023 to provide a transitional period
for emitters to adjust.</p>
<p><strong>Key Updates to Singapore's Carbon Tax from 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>To support our net zero target, <strong>the carbon tax was raised to S$25/tCO<sub>2</sub>e with effect from 2024. It will be raised to S$45/tCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2026 and 2027, with a view to reaching S$50-80/tCO<sub>2</sub>e by 2030</strong>.
This will strengthen the price signal and impetus for businesses and individuals
to reduce their carbon footprint in line with national climate goals.</p>

</div>
<p>The revised carbon tax trajectory is critical in enabling the pace of
transformation needed to achieve our raised climate ambition and make the
economy- and society-wide transition to a low-carbon future. It also helps
businesses remain competitive in a low-carbon future, by enhancing the
business case to invest in low-carbon solutions, and ensuring that new
investments and economic activities are aligned with our national climate
goals.</p>
<p>The Government does not expect to derive additional revenue from the carbon
tax increase in this decade. The revenue will be used to support decarbonisation
efforts and the transition to a green economy, and cushion the impact on
businesses and households.</p>
<p><strong>Use of International Carbon Credits</strong>
</p>
<p>Companies may use high quality international carbon credits (ICCs) to
offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions from 2024. This will cushion
the impact for companies that are able to source for eligible carbon credits
in a cost-effective manner, help to create local demand for high-quality
carbon credits, and catalyse the development of well-functioning and regulated
carbon markets. Eligible ICCs used under the carbon tax regime will need
to comply with rules under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, and meet seven
principles to demonstrate high environmental integrity. More details can
be found at Singapore’s Carbon Markets Cooperation <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/" class="Hyperlink SCXW29903298 BCX0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Transition Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>The government has introduced a transition framework to provide support
for emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) companies as they work to
reduce emissions and invest in cleaner technologies, while managing the
near-term impact on business competitiveness. The framework will also help
to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage.</p>
<p>The amount of allowances awarded to each facility is determined based
on its performance on internationally-recognised efficiency benchmarks
where available, and the facility’s decarbonisation plans. These transitory
allowances are limited to only a portion of companies’ emissions, and the
amount awarded to eligible facilities will also be reviewed regularly.
New investments will not qualify for the transition framework. Similar
frameworks have been implemented in other jurisdictions with carbon pricing
schemes, including the EU, South Korea, and California.</p>
<p><strong>Updates to list of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and associated Global Warming Potential (GWP) values</strong>
</p>
<p>The list of GHGs and their GWP values has been updated in the First Schedule
of the Carbon Pricing Act, in&nbsp;line with newer standards adopted by
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The carbon tax coverage was also expanded to include Nitrogen Trifluoride
(NF<sub>3</sub>) from 2024 onwards.</p>
<h4>FAQs</h4>
<p><strong>1. Who is covered under the carbon tax?</strong>
</p>
<p>The carbon tax is levied on facilities that directly emit at least 25,000
tCO<sub>2</sub>e of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually. It currently
covers seven GHGs, namely carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>),
nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons
(PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>)<u>,</u> and Nitrogen Trifluoride
(NF<sub>3</sub>).</p>
<p>In all, the carbon tax currently covers around 80% of our total GHG emissions
from around 50 facilities in the manufacturing, power, waste, and water
sectors. Facilities in other sectors also indirectly face a carbon price
on the electricity they consume as power generation companies are expected
to pass on some degree of their own tax burden through increased electricity
tariffs. After we accounting for fuel excise duties that incentivises the
reduction of transport emissions, the overall coverage rises to about 90%.</p>
<p><strong>2. How are emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) sectors determined? Why is there a need for the transition framework for EITE sectors?</strong>
</p>
<p>EITE sectors face a higher risk of carbon leakage, where companies relocate
to other jurisdictions with less stringent climate policies as a result
of intense competition in the global market. Examples of EITE sectors include
chemicals, electronics and biomedical manufacturing sectors, while non-EITE
sectors include domestic-oriented sectors like power generation and waste
management.</p>
<p>As the Government raises the carbon tax, companies in EITE sectors may
face higher costs than their counterparts in jurisdictions with no or lower
effective carbon prices. These companies contribute a significant number
of jobs and value-added to our economy. Some will require more time to
make the necessary reduction in emissions or investment in cleaner technologies.
By providing for a transition framework, the Government seeks to alleviate
the near-term impact on business competitiveness and minimise the risk
of carbon leakage.</p>
<p>To encourage decarbonisation, transitory allowances are provided for only
a portion of companies’ emissions. Similar frameworks have been implemented
in other jurisdictions with carbon pricing schemes, including the EU, South
Korea, and California.</p>
<p><strong>3. Which other countries or jurisdictions have implemented carbon pricing?</strong>
</p>
<p>Carbon pricing has been implemented in many countries, with more planning
to implement them in the future. There are 73 carbon pricing instruments
in operation (one regional, 39 national and 33 subnational jurisdictions),
covering about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023.<sup>1</sup> A
few of these jurisdictions such as Finland, Norway and Sweden have implemented
carbon pricing as early as the 1990s. Other jurisdictions within the region
that have announced plans to price carbon and introduce new carbon regulations
include Thailand and Brunei.</p>
<p><strong>4. How will the increased carbon tax levels affect individuals and households? What support will be available to households, especially low-income households, to cope with the rising cost of living from the carbon tax increase?</strong>
</p>
<p>Although the carbon tax is directly levied upstream of large emitters,
it could flow through in the form of higher electricity tariffs as power
companies pass on the carbon tax to end users. On average, with every $5/tCO<sub>2</sub>e
increase in the carbon tax level, electricity tariffs could rise by 1%.
The increase in carbon tax to $25/tCO<sub>2</sub>e is estimated to translate
to an increase of about $4 per month in household utility bills for the
average 4-room HDB flat.</p>
<p>The carbon tax is needed to put a price on the externality or social cost
of carbon, so as to shape the behaviour of individuals and households to
reduce their energy consumption and be more energy efficient, to enable
us to meet our long-term commitments. Notwithstanding, the Government is
committed to help Singaporean households cope with the rising cost of living,
whether this is driven by carbon tax or other factors.</p>
<p>As announced at Budget 2024, additional U-Save rebates will also be disbursed
as part of the enhanced Assurance Package to help HDB households cope with
the increases in utility bills. Eligible HDB households will receive 2.5
times the amount of regular GSTV – U-Save, or up to $950, in the 2024 financial
year.</p>
<p>Support is also provided to help households reduce their emissions. The
Government introduced the <a href="https://www.climate-friendly-households.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Climate Friendly Households Programme</a>&nbsp;(CFHP)
in 2020 to provide eligible&nbsp;households with vouchers to offset the
cost of purchasing more resource efficient and climate-friendly appliances.
These vouchers can be used to purchase 3-ticks water efficient shower fittings
(inclusive of installation costs if required), LED lights, and energy efficient
and climate-friendly refrigerators. By switching to these appliances, households
can do their part for the environment by reducing their energy and water
consumption while saving costs in the long run. From 15 April 2024, the
Government will also expand the CFHP to more households.</p>
<p><strong>5. How would the Government ensure that consumers are not over-charged by electricity retailers passing on more than 100 per cent of the carbon tax to consumers?</strong>
</p>
<p>Today’s electricity retail market is competitive and discourages retailers
from raising their electricity rates excessively. Nevertheless, Energy
Market Authority will continue to ensure fair and efficient conduct of
market players. Government agencies will also work closely with the Consumer
Association of Singapore and Competition &amp; Consumer Commission of Singapore
to monitor the market for unfair pricing and coordinated price hikes which
are anti-competitive.</p>
<p><strong>6. Why are we allowing carbon tax liable facilities to offset only up to 5% of their emissions using international carbon credits from 2024?</strong>
</p>
<p>The facility-level limit has been set at 5% to ensure that the industry
continues to prioritise domestic emissions reduction, while providing an
additional decarbonisation pathway for hard-to-abate sectors that may find
it challenging to significantly cut emissions in the near to medium term.
This limit is aligned with other comparable jurisdictions with similar
climate ambitions, such as South Korea and California. We will continue
to review the facility-level limit overtime to align with international
developments.</p>
