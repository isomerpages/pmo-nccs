### Household

Singapore has taken steps to [reduce energy consumption of the household sector](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency/household-sector/), which accounts for about 15% of our total electricity consumption. The Minimum Energy Performance Standards — which have been progressively tightened over the years — improves the energy efficiency of household appliances such as refrigerators, air-conditioners, clothes dryers and lamps. To help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions, the Government has also progressively expanded the [Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/climate-change-energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency/household-sector/about-mandatory-energy-labelling-and-minimum-energy-performance-standards) to cover an increasing variety of appliances.

Singapore will continue to provide support to households impacted by the low-carbon transition, through initiatives such as the [Climate Friendly Household Programme](https://www.climate-friendly-households.gov.sg) to defray the costs of switching to more resource-efficient and climate-friendly appliances for lower-income households.
