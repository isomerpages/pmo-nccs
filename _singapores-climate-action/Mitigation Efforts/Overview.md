### Overview

Singapore has committed to [achieving net zero emissions by 2050](/singapores-climate-action/singapores-climate-targets/overview/). Despite the [challenging geographical constraints we face](/singapores-climate-action/overview/national-circumstances), we will continue to find innovative ways to accelerate the low-carbon transition for industry, economy and society through four key thrusts:

*   Catalysing business transformation;
*   Investing in low-carbon technologies;
*   Pursuing effective international cooperation; and
*   Adopting low-carbon practices.

These key thrusts are supported by a [carbon tax](/singapores-climate-action/mitigation-efforts/carbontax/), as a key enabler of this transition.
