<h3>POWER</h3>
<p>Power generation is one of the major sources of Singapore’s carbon emissions
and accounts for about 40% of <a href="/singapores-climate-action/singapores-climate-targets/singapore-emissions-profile/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">our emissions today</a>.
With our limited capacity to tap on <a href="/singapores-climate-action/singapore-approach-to-alternative-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">alternative energy sources</a>,
we currently rely heavily on imported natural gas to power our nation.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Reset: A More Environmentally Friendly Method to Power Our Nation</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore will harness and tap on the four switches to <a href="https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/key-focus-areas/energy-reset/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">transform our energy supply</a>:
Solar, Regional Power Grids, Emerging Low-Carbon Alternatives, and Natural
Gas.</p>
<p><em>Solar</em>
</p>
<p>Solar remains the most promising renewable energy source for Singapore.
We are pressing ahead with ambitious solar deployment plans to achieve
our target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030, which will generate
enough energy to meet around 3% of Singapore’s total projected electricity
demand in that year.&nbsp; As part of our efforts to encourage solar energy
deployment, the government has launched various tenders and initiatives
such as the <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/solarnova-page" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SolarNova programme</a>,
JTC’s SolarLand and SolarRoof programme and PUB’s floating solar systems.
As at Jan 2023, seven tenders equivalent to more than 440 megawatt-peak
(MWp) of solar energy have been awarded under the SolarNova programme.</p>
<p>Although solar power is Singapore’s most viable renewable energy alternative,
it is not land-efficient. Therefore, its scale-up is fundamentally limited
by our land constraints. Nevertheless, the Government will continue to
review our longer-term strategies for maximising solar power, and actively
invest in R&amp;D and test-bedding to increase efficiency and optimise
space utilisation, including through the deployment of floating solar farms
and vertical panel installations.</p>
<p>To enhance the resilience of our power grid and mitigate solar intermittency,
the Energy Market Authority (EMA) appointed Sembcorp Industries to build,
own and operate a utility-scale Energy Storage Systems (ESS). The 285 megawatt-hour
(MWh) ESS facility is the largest deployment in Southeast Asia, and the
fastest of its size to be deployed, in the world.</p>

</p>
<p><em>Regional Power Grids</em>
</p>
<p>To ensure adequate supply to meet Singapore's future energy needs, Singapore
is seeking to import around 6 GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035, up
from the initial target of 4 GW. This is expected to be around one-third
of our energy demand then.</p>
<p>As a pathfinder to the ASEAN Power Grid, Singapore has <a href="https://www.ema.gov.sg/news-events/news/media-releases/2022/singapore-commences-first-renewable-energy-electricity-import-via-regional-multilateral-power-trade" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">begun importing renewable hydropower from the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) since June 2022</a>,
using existing interconnections via Thailand and Malaysia, as part of the
Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP).</p>
<p>To further develop and refine our technical and regulatory frameworks
for large-scale electricity imports, Singapore has also announced two small-scale
trial imports of electricity: <a href="https://www.ema.gov.sg/electricity-imports.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">100 MW from Peninsular Malaysia and 100 MW from a solar farm in Pulau Bulan, Indonesia</a>.</p>
<p><em>Emerging Low-Carbon Alternatives</em>
</p>
<p>Singapore is studying emerging low-carbon technologies like hydrogen,
<a href="/singapores-climate-action/mitigation-efforts/industry/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS)</a>, and advanced geothermal
systems as possible paths to decarbonising our power sector. Under the
<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/research/funding-opportunities/lcer-fi-grant" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Low-Carbon Energy Research (LCER) Funding Initiative</a>, we have awarded
S$55 million to support 12 research, development and demonstration projects
on low-carbon hydrogen and CCUS, with another S$129 million set aside for
the next phase of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Carbon Hydrogen</strong>
</p>
<p>Given its potential as an alternative fuel and industrial feedstock, low-carbon
hydrogen has emerged as a key potential decarbonisation pathway for Singapore.
Although many low-carbon hydrogen technologies and supply chains are still
nascent, Singapore is taking steps to prepare for hydrogen deployment.
Our <a href="https://www.mti.gov.sg/Industries/Hydrogen" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Hydrogen Strategy</a> is
organised around five key thrusts:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Experimenting with the use of advanced hydrogen technologies at the cusp
of commercial readiness through pathfinder projects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investing in research and development (R&amp;D) to unlock key technological
bottlenecks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pursuing international collaboration to enable supply chains for low-carbon
hydrogen;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undertaking long-term land and infrastructure planning; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting workforce training and development of our broader hydrogen
economy, so that Singaporeans will be ready to capture new opportunities
in the global hydrogen economy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To kickstart our efforts, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) and the Maritime
Port Authority (MPA) had jointly called for interested parties to submit
proposals under an Expression-of-Interest to build, own and operate low
or zero-carbon power generation and bunkering solutions in December 2022.</p>
<p>Singapore also published a hydrogen feasibility study report, <a href="https://file.go.gov.sg/studyofhydrogenimportsanddownstreamapplicationsforsingapore.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“Study of Hydrogen Imports and Downstream Applications for Singapore”</a>,
which was jointly commissioned by the National Climate Change Secretariat
(NCCS), Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB) and Energy Market
Authority (EMA) and concluded in June 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS)</strong>
</p>
<p>We are also exploring possible CCUS deployment pathways. Carbon dioxide
captured could be sequestered in suitable sub-surface geological formations,
utilised as feedstock for synthetic fuels or as building materials through
mineralisation. Singapore will continue to monitor technological and market
developments, and scale up deployment as pathways become techno-economically
viable.</p>
<p>In July 2025, EMA commissioned three power generation companies to <a href="https://www.ema.gov.sg/news-events/news/media-releases/2025/three-gencos-to-conduct-ccs-studies" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">conduct carbon capture and storage (CCS) feasibility studies.</a> Two
power sector CCS pathways are studied: (a) post-combustion carbon capture
and (b) pre-combustion carbon capture. Findings from the feasibility studies
will provide insights into the power sector CCS pathways, identify infrastructure
requirements, and further assess the feasibility of CCS to decarbonise
the power sector.</p>

<p><em>Natural Gas</em>
</p>
<p>Since 2000, Singapore has shifted away from less efficient fossil fuels
and in turn increased the percentage of natural gas used in electricity
generation from 19% to about 94% in 2924.</p>
<p>Natural gas will continue to be an important fuel for Singapore in the
near future as we scale up our other switches. We will continue working
with the industry to improve the energy and carbon efficiency of natural
gas generation units during this transition.</p>
<p>Among all fossil fuels, natural gas produces the least amount of carbon
emissions per unit of electricity. Singapore's fuel mix allows our emission
to be much less carbon intensive than other nations that still use coal
as an important part of their power generation. <a href="https://www.ema.gov.sg/resources/singapore-energy-statistics/chapter2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore's Grid Emission Factor</a> —
a measure of the carbon intensity of electricity generation — has fallen
from 0.409 kgCO<sub>2</sub>/kWh in 2019 to 0.402 kgCO<sub>2</sub>/kWh in
2024.</p>
