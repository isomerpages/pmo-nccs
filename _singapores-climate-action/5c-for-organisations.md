### FOR ORGANISATIONS

**Become Part of the National Effort to Tackle Climate Change**  
Organisations can play their part in reducing emissions by understanding the environmental impact of their business operations and by adopting carbon-friendly measures and practices.

**Be Part of the Solution**  
Your organisation can help in the fight against climate change in a number of ways. As part of practising corporate social responsibility (CSR), you can take steps to reduce your organisation's carbon footprint or organise activities to promote community and stakeholder action on climate change.

You can also get involved in the adoption and/or development of green technology solutions aimed at reducing your corporate carbon footprint.


### ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP

Singapore's economic and environmental achievements are the result of the collective commitment by our People, Public and Private (3P) sectors. The government's efforts to raise public awareness and promote action on climate change are complemented by proactive businesses, organisations and community and youth groups that have initiated similar programmes. The following programmes illustrate our collective efforts:

**Educational Programmes**

* Students are exposed to environmental education inside and outside of the classroom. Climate change is discussed in subjects such as general paper, economics, geography and the sciences. School excursions are organised to visit power stations, incineration plants, meteorological stations and green buildings, which highlight the effects of climate change and practical methods to reduce emissions.  
* The *Climate Change Climate Challenge* exhibition at the Science Centre also explains to students and members of the public alike the causes of climate change, its impact, and how everyone can play a part in reducing Singapore's carbon footprint.

### National, Community and Corporate Programmes

* The annual Clean & Green Singapore campaign encourages Singaporeans to care for and protect the environment by adopting environment-friendly lifestyles.  
* Project SWITCH (Simple Ways I Take to Change my Habits), created by the Central Singapore Community Development Council (CDC) promotes energy conservation, adoption of the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle) and greener travel methods. Grassroots organisations and CDC staff conduct house visits to explain the impact of simple lifestyle changes to residents.  
* Earth Hour, created by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), is an example of a climate change initiative led by a non-governmental organisation. Held annually since 2007, the event encourages individuals and organisations to switch off their lights for one hour on the last Saturday evening of March. Participants are encouraged to go "beyond the hour" to protect the environment.  
* Retailers such as Best Denki support energy efficiency outreach by providing consumers with information on the monetary savings offered by energy efficient appliances to guide "greener" purchases of electrical appliances.

### Capacity Building

* Organisations can leverage on the National Environment Agency's (NEA) [<a href="http://www.nea.gov.sg/grants-awards/3p-partnership-fund" target="_blank">3P Partnership Fund</a>](http://www.nea.gov.sg/grants-awards/3p-partnership-fund) to co-create environmental education and outreach activities on climate change related topics.  
* Companies can also participate in NEA's Corporate and Schools Partnership Programme (CASP) to groom young student leaders by establishing joint environmental programmes and providing mentors to transfer technical knowledge.
