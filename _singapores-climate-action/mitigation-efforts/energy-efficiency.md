### ENERGY EFFICIENCY

Singapore has identified the following thrusts in our energy efficiency strategy:

* Promoting the adoption of energy efficient measures and technologies
* Building our capability to sustain and drive energy efficiency efforts and developing a local knowledge base in energy management    
* Raising awareness amongst the public, households and industry / businesses  
* Supporting research and development efforts to enhance Singapore's capability in energy efficient technologies

The [<a href="http://www.e2singapore.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Energy Efficient Programme Office (E²PO)</a>](http://www.e2singapore.gov.sg/) was established in 2007 to drive energy efficiency improvements in the various sectors of the economy. E²PO is a multi-agency committee co-led by the National Environment Agency and the Energy Market Authority.

Measures are being implemented across all key sectors: power generation, industry, transport, building and households as well as water and waste management.


### Household Sector 

We can all help in the action against climate change by having an energy-efficient home, buying energy-efficient appliances and adopting energy-saving habits. By conserving energy, households can also save money with lower utility bills. 

The Government has implemented several initiatives to empower houseowners to make better choices and influence usage behaviour. 

Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme (MELS) and Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) are key policies undertaken to improve energy efficiency of a range of household appliances.  

MELS, introduced in 2008, requires suppliers of major energy-consuming household appliances to affix their products with energy labels. This will help customers compare energy efficiency and make more informed purchasing decisions. 

MEPS sets standards for minimum energy performance or maximum energy consumptions thus removing appliances which are energy inefficient from the market and raising the average energy efficiency of household appliance.
