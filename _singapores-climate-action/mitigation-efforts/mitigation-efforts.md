### MITIGATION EFFORTS

As the vast majority of carbon emissions originate from the combustion of fossil fuels for energy, the most direct way to reduce emissions is to cut down on the use of fossil fuels. While we are actively supporting research on clean energy technologies, Singapore has limited access to alternative or renewable energy.

Despite these challenges, we have taken the next best step by switching from carbon-intensive fuel oil to natural gas, which has lower carbon content per unit of electricity generated. However, there are limits to how much further we can reduce emissions, since natural gas already constitutes more than 95 per cent of our fuel mix for electricity generation today. Therefore, improving energy efficiency is a key focus of our efforts to reduce emissions.
