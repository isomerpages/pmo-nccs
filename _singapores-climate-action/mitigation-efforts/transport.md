### TRANSPORT

As part of the [<a href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/who_we_are/our_work/land_transport_master_plan_2040.html" target="_blank">Land Transport Master Plan 2040</a>](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/who_we_are/our_work/land_transport_master_plan_2040.html), the Land Transport Authority (LTA) aims for nine in 10 peak-period journeys to be made via Walk-Cycle-Ride modes of transport (which include public and shared transport such as taxis and private hire cars), and to have 100 per cent greener, cleaner energy public bus and taxi fleets by 2040. 

Singapore plans to further reduce emissions by switching to cleaner-energy vehicles.  Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles will be phased out by 2040.  All newly registered vehicles will be cleaner-energy models starting from 2030. To support the growth of Electric Vehicles,  the Government is aiming to deploy 60,000 charging points at public carparks and private premises by 2030. 

The Government is also enhancing existing transport facilities to make them more environmentally friendly, and designing and building new land transport, airport and port facilities that are sustainable and green, through incorporating energy efficient and carbon mitigation features and technologies.
