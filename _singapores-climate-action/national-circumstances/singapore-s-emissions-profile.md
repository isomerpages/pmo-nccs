### SINGAPORE'S EMISSIONS PROFILE

Singapore contributes around 0.1 per cent of global emissions. We are nevertheless taking steps to reduce our carbon emissions.

Historically, our strategic position along the East-West trade routes has made Singapore a natural location for oil storage and refining facilities serving the region. Building on our position as a key regional port, the refining and petrochemical plants help create synergies and are part of a business supply network in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, South Asia and Australasia. Although the refining and petrochemical sector is a large source of our carbon emissions, energy efficiency improvement will remain a key strategy to reduce the industry sector's emissions.
