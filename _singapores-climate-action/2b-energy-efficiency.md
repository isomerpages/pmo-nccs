### ENERGY EFFICIENCY

Singapore has identified the following thrusts in our energy efficiency strategy:

* Promoting the adoption of energy efficient measures and technologies
* Building our capability to sustain and drive energy efficiency efforts and developing a local knowledge base in energy management    
* Raising awareness amongst the public, households and industry / businesses  
* Supporting research and development efforts to enhance Singapore's capability in energy efficient technologies

The [<a href="http://www.e2singapore.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Energy Efficient Programme Office (E²PO)</a>](http://www.e2singapore.gov.sg/) was established in 2007 to drive energy efficiency improvements in the various sectors of the economy. E²PO is a multi-agency committee co-led by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Energy Market Authority (EMA).

Measures are being implemented across all key sectors: power generation, industry, transport, building and households as well as water and waste management.
