### WASTE AND WATER

**Combating Waste Emissions**  
Our overall waste management strategy aims to reduce emissions from waste through the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle), and by incinerating the remaining refuse in waste-to-energy plants. Incineration is preferable to land filling, since the direct burial of waste produces methane, a greenhouse gas.

We aim to improve our current recycling rate of 59 per cent to 70 per cent by 2030 by looking into different ways to reduce emissions. This includes the policy of recycling more plastic waste instead of incinerating it.

**Reducing Methane from Wastewater**  
We also seek to reduce direct methane emissions from wastewater sludge through incineration. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and ECO-Special Waste Management (ECO-SWM) have collaborated on the development of one of Southeast Asia's largest sludge incineration plants in Singapore.

With an estimated annual average reduction of 129,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e), the plant has been registered as an emissions reduction project with United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and will generate carbon credits in Singapore.

**Reducing Energy Usage by Desalination**  
Desalinated water is one of Singapore's water supply sources, meeting about 10 per cent of the country's water needs. We have been investing in R&D to improve the energy efficiency of the desalination process. One such project uses electrochemical desalting to reduce energy usage to less than half the volume currently being used by membrane-based desalination methods.
