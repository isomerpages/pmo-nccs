### GREEN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

Climate change, fossil fuel depletion and rapid urbanisation are driving countries to deploy cleaner and more sustainable energy solutions. While climate change clearly poses significant global challenges, it also provides strong incentives for entrepreneurship, research and development (R&D) and creative problem-solving to help cities and communities anticipate, prepare for and adapt to its impact.

There are many opportunities for Singapore to develop as a green growth hub that provides green solutions to the world.
