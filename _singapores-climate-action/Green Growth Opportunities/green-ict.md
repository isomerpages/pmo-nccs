### GREEN ICT

With a vibrant and thriving green information and communication technologies (ICT) industry comprising more than 80 of the top 100 software and services companies in the world, Singapore is at the forefront of green ICT development. The Infocomm Media Development Agency (IMDA) routinely works with industry partners and companies to advance Singaporeâ€™s position within the ICT industry. This makes us the perfect location for companies looking to develop and test bed new solutions.


IMDA has established the **Green Data Centre Innovation Programme (GDCIP)** to support high impact research, development and demonstration (RD&D) in data centre efficiency in Singapore. It consists of three initiatives:

*	The **Green Data Centre Research Grant Call** provides research funding for key areas of research that can be multi-disciplinary in nature, and focuses on technology transfer into actual products and services. Collaboration between the research community and the industry is strongly encouraged. 
*	The **Green Data Centre Innovation Call-for-Collaboration** spurs innovation by catalysing the development and adoption of innovative green data centre related products, solutions and services. IMDA intends to invite proposals from the industry to prototype and pilot innovative solutions that cut across the facilities, ICT systems and design to significantly improve the energy efficiency of local data centres.
*	IMDA will work with the industry to build and manage a **Green Data Centre Innovation Hub** to demonstrate emerging technologies and innovations that can be adopted by data centres. The Hub, as a data centre platform, will take a coordinated and multi-disciplinary approach towards open collaborations amongst industry. 
*	IMDA will continue to **develop policies and guidelines** related to resource efficiency such as energy use by data centres in Singapore to achieve a sustainable computing infrastructure.


<!-- A tax incentive was introduced in 2012 to encourage data centre operators to be more energy efficient. Under the Investment Allowance Scheme for Energy Efficiency Projects (Data Centres), eligible companies will be granted an investment allowance to offset 30 per cent to 50 per cent of the fixed capital expenditure incurred in implementing energy efficiency retrofits for their data centres. -->
