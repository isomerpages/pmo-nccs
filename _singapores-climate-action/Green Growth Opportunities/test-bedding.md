### TEST BEDDING

Singapore has developed a suite of supporting services and opportunities for firms and researchers to develop, test and validate clean-energy technologies in real-world settings. Test bedding facilitates the commercialisation process for new technologies and positions Singapore as a "living laboratory" to evaluate, pilot and commercialise innovative solutions for Asian and global markets.

**Examples of Test Beds in Singapore**

* **[CleanTech Park](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/industries/hub/infrastructure-hub/build-on-singapores-infrastructure-ecosystem/notable-projects/jtc-cleantech-park )** is being developed by JTC Corporation as the first eco-business park in the region. It will cluster clean technology companies together and serve as a platform for test bedding and prototyping of clean technologies and sustainable urban solutions. The 50ha Park at Nanyang Avenue will be developed in three phases over the next 20 years. Upon completion, it will house a working population of 20,000 green collar workers.

* **Floating Solar** PV Pilot is a joint project between the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and national water agency PUB. The pilot project, a first of its kind in the region, aims to assess the feasibility and cost effectiveness of installing floating solar photovoltaic (PV) systems on freshwater reservoirs.

* **[The Renewable Energy Integration Demonstrator in Singapore ](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/erian/research-capabilities/renewable-energy-integration-demonstrator---singapore#:~:text=The%20Renewable%20Energy%20Integration%20Demonstrator,as%20the%20future%20of%20urban  )** (REIDS) is a large-scale offshore test and demonstration microgrid located in Semakau Landfill which integrates renewable energy production from solar, wind, tidal, biofuel and fuel cells with smart grid technologies.

* **[<a href="http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/punggol-eco-town" target="_blank">Punggol Eco-Town</a>](http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/punggol-eco-town)** demonstrates sustainable urban planning and design, green technology adoption and active community partnership. Social, economic and environmental considerations have been formulated by HDB to steer its development. LED lighting and elevator energy regenerative systems, renewable solar energy, water conservation and rainwater harvesting systems, and recycling solutions are some of the technologies and solutions being test-bedded. HDB is also working with government agencies such as the EMA to pilot the IES smart grid project, and with industry partners such as Panasonic to test-bed Home Energy Management Systems, to monitor energy consumption to reduce overall energy consumption within the town.

* The HDB **[<a href="http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/hdb-greenprint" target="_blank">Greenprint</a>](http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/hdb-greenprint)** is a framework of goals and strategies to guide town development, in alignment with Singapore's Sustainable Blueprint targets to reduce the consumption of resources from current Business-As-Usual levels. Greenprint aims to create sustainable homes with the community in both existing and new HDB towns. HDB will pilot the Greenprint in 38 blocks of flats in the Yuhua estate in Jurong, refining the framework to suit the needs of different towns.

* **[<a href="https://www.ema.gov.sg/Electric_Vehicles_Test_Bed.aspx" target="_blank">Electric Vehicle (EV) Test Bed</a>](https://www.ema.gov.sg/Electric_Vehicles_Test_Bed.aspx)** is driven by a multi-agency EV Taskforce co-led by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) and the Land Transport Authority (LTA). It aims to assess different EV prototypes and charging technologies under Singapore's urbanised environment and road conditions. Phase 1 of the test-bed was launched in June 2011 and completed in December 2013. Phase 2 will be an EV car-sharing programme which will introduce up to 1,000 EVs and the charging infrastructure to trial viability of implementing EV fleets and catalyse widespread adoption of EVs. It expected to be launched in 2016.

* **[<a href="https://www.bca.gov.sg/zeb/" target="_blank">Zero Energy Building</a>](https://www.bca.gov.sg/zeb/)** is a 4,500m² Building and Construction Authority (BCA) flagship project under the Green Building Masterplan. The building generates its own electricity from solar panels and reduces its energy needs through the use of green building technology and design. It now serves as a test-bedding facility for the integration of green building technology into existing buildings. Since its launch in Oct 2009, ZEB has managed to achieve net zero energy consumption for 3 consecutive years.

* **[<a href="https://www.jld.sg/" target="_blank">Jurong Lake District</a>](https://www.jld.sg/)** (JLD) is one of the new growth areas identified in the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) Master Plan 2008 to support Singapore's economic growth for the next 10 to 15 years, and to decentralise commercial activities out of the city centre by bringing jobs closer to where people live. JLD is envisioned to be a model for a mixed-used urban precinct that is sustainable, smart and connected. The government will collaborate with the industry to conduct pilots and trials of smart technologies within JLD.

* **[<a href="http://ecocampus.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank">NTU EcoCampus</a>](http://ecocampus.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/index.aspx)** - In partnership with EDB and JTC, the EcoCampus initiative will transform NTU's 200-hectare campus into a super test bed for research projects in cutting-edge green technologies. They range from smart building systems and renewable energy, to electric transportation and water conservation technologies, complementing the vibrant sustainability R&D community in the adjoining 50-hectare CleanTech Park developed by JTC Corporation.

* **Smart Campus Platform** - Temasek Polytechnic, on January 2015, announced their collaboration with private sector firms such as Cisco, EMC, NCS and Johnson Controls, focusing on ICT solutions for education. The platform will utilise innovative technologies to collect and analyse data to improve decision making on campus, enhancing the work and education experience on campus.
