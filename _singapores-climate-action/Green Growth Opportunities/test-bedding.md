<h3>TEST BEDDING</h3>
<p>Singapore has developed a suite of supporting services and opportunities
for firms and researchers to develop, test and validate clean-energy technologies
in real-world settings. Test bedding facilitates the commercialisation
process for new technologies and positions Singapore as a "living laboratory"
to evaluate, pilot and commercialise innovative solutions for Asian and
global markets.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Test Beds in Singapore</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/grow-your-business/partner-with-singapore/infrastructure/notable-projects/cleantech-park" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CleanTech Park</a></strong> is
being developed by JTC Corporation as the first eco-business park in the
region. It will cluster clean technology companies together and serve as
a platform for test bedding and prototyping of clean technologies and sustainable
urban solutions. The 50ha Park at Nanyang Avenue will be developed in three
phases over the next 20 years. Upon completion, it will house a working
population of 20,000 green collar workers.</p>

<p>PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, in collaboration with Singapore
Economic Development Board (EDB), launched a 1 megawatt-peak (MWp) <strong><a href="https://www.pub.gov.sg/Public/WaterLoop/Sustainability/Solar/Floating" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">floating solar photovoltaic (PV) testbed</a></strong> at
Tengeh Reservoir in 2016. The pilot project aims to assess the feasibility
and cost effectiveness of installing floating solar PV systems on freshwater
reservoirs. Through such solar deployments, PUB seeks to generate renewable
energy to power its operations and reduce carbon footprint. The results
were favourable and showed that floating solar PV systems performed 5 to
15 per cent better than a typical rooftop solar PV system in Singapore,
primarily due to the cooler temperatures of the reservoir environment.
After extensive studies, PUB built two small-scale pilots of 1.5MWp floating
solar PV systems in Lower Seletar Reservoir and Bedok Reservoir, as well
as a large scale 60MWp floating solar PV system in Tengeh Reservoir. Continuous
monitoring at the floating solar PV systems has shown that water quality
is not affected and there is no significant impact on wildlife at the reservoirs.
PUB will continue to explore the solar deployment potential of other reservoirs
in Singapore. Slated for completion in 2028, the upcoming 86 MWp floating
solar PV system on Pandan Reservoir will be PUB’s second large-scale floating
PV project.</p>

is a large-scale offshore test and demonstration microgrid located in Semakau
Landfill which integrates renewable energy production from solar, wind,

<p><strong><a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/punggol-ecotown" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Punggol Eco-Town </a></strong>demonstrates
sustainable urban planning and design, green technology adoption and active
community partnership. Social, economic and environmental considerations
have been formulated by HDB to steer its development. LED lighting and
elevator energy regenerative systems, renewable solar energy, water conservation
and rainwater harvesting systems, and recycling solutions are some of the
technologies and solutions being test-bedded. HDB is also working with
government agencies such as the EMA to pilot the IES smart grid project,
and with industry partners such as Panasonic to test-bed Home Energy Management
Systems, to monitor energy consumption to reduce overall energy consumption
within the town.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.jtc.gov.sg/punggoldigitaldistrict" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Punggol Digital District</a></strong> is
a 50ha business park district located within Punggol Town. It is targeted
at key growth industries of the digital economy, such as cybersecurity,
machine learning, IoT and smart city solutions. The project also showcases
smart nation initiatives, and companies can test-bed the latest smart city
ideas and technologies.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/hdb-greenprint" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">HDB Greenprint</a></strong> is
a framework of goals and strategies to guide town development, in alignment
with Singapore's Sustainable Blueprint targets to reduce the consumption
of resources from current Business-As-Usual levels. Greenprint aims to
create sustainable homes with the community in both existing and new HDB
towns. The pilot programme in the Yuhua estate was launched in 2012 and
was completed by 2015. It aimed to introduce energy-efficient, water management
and waste management features to the estate. In 2015, the programme was
extended to 40 blocks of flats in the Teck Ghee estate.</p>

driven by a multi-agency EV Taskforce co-led by the Energy Market Authority
(EMA) and the Land Transport Authority (LTA). It aims to assess different
EV prototypes and charging technologies under Singapore's urbanised environment
and road conditions. Phase 1 of the test-bed was launched in June 2011
and completed in December 2013. Phase 2 will be an EV car-sharing programme
which will introduce up to 1,000 EVs and the charging infrastructure to
trial viability of implementing EV fleets and catalyse widespread adoption
of EVs. Singapore largest vehicle-to-grid (V2G) test bed to date was launched
in 2023 in the Punggol region.</p>

BCA’s Braddell Campus is envisioned to be a collaborative space to connect
like-minded individuals, showcase innovative technologies and ideas, and
transfer knowledge to accelerate the transformation of the Built Environment
(BE). One use of the space is for it to be a “living laboratory”, allowing
collaborators to be co-located on the same campus, so as to be able to
conduct research, test-bed and refine in-demand BE solutions in a real
world environment. One example is the <strong><a href="https://www.bcaa.edu.sg/who-we-are/learning-journeys/zeb-plus-building" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Zero Energy Building Plus (ZEB Plus) </a></strong>demonstration
facility that has evolved from achieving net zero energy consumption since
2009 to becoming Singapore's first positive energy building in 2022.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.jld.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Jurong Lake District </a></strong>(JLD)
is one of the new growth areas identified in the Urban Redevelopment Authority's
(URA) Master Plan 2008 to support Singapore's economic growth for the next
10 to 15 years, and to decentralise commercial activities out of the city
centre by bringing jobs closer to where people live. JLD is envisioned
to be a model for a mixed-used urban precinct that is sustainable, smart
and connected. The government will collaborate with the industry to conduct
pilots and trials of smart technologies within JLD. In October 2022, Singapore
announced that Jurong Lake District will aim to achieve net zero emissions
for new developments around 2045.</p>
