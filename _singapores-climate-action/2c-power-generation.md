### POWER GENERATION

Power generation is one of the major sources of carbon emissions. With our limited capacity to tap on alternative energy resources, we rely heavily on imported fossil fuel to power our nation.

**A More Environment-friendly Method to Power Our Nation**

Since 2000, we have increased the percentage of natural gas used in electricity generation from 19 per cent to 95 per cent today. Among all fossil fuels, natural gas produces the least amount of carbon emissions per unit of electricity. By so doing, we have cut the amount of carbon we release into the atmosphere.

Our fuel mix makes us much less carbon intensive than many other nations still use coal as an important part of their power generation.

*Singapore has switched from fuel oil to natural gas as out main energy source for electricity generation. The picture above shows Senoko Energy's repowered units that were completed in 2005. The repowering involved the conversion of three oil-fired steam thermal plants into three gas-fired combined cycle plant. (Image courtesy of Senoko Energy)*

**Decreasing Our Fuel Oil Usage**

Our electricity is produced by the combustion of natural gas that is piped from Malaysia and Indonesia. We have diversified our supply of natural gas with the development of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal on Jurong Island. There are further plans to build a second LNG terminal to support new industrial sites and power plants. This will not only provide critical mass for enhanced energy security, but it will also enable Singapore to be a hub for LNG-related businesses.

**Finding Ways to Increase Solar Power Generation**

Among the alternative energy options available to us, solar energy offers the most promising opportunity for Singapore. With the fall in solar photovoltaic (PV) panel prices, solar energy is currently economically comparable to electricity derived from fossil fuels.

To accelerate solar deployment in Singapore, the SolarNova programme has been launched to promote and aggregate solar demand across government agencies. In Nov 2015, the first SolarNova tender was awarded for solar photovoltaic (PV) systems to be deployed on the facilities of government agencies including the Housing Development Board (HDB), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and PUB, the national water angecy.

**Notable Solar Installations**

The total installed solar PV capacity in Singapore is currently about 47 megawatt peak (MWp) for both residential and non-residential areas. This includes installations at:

* HDB rooftops  
* Keppel Seghers Ulu Pandan NEWater Plant  
* Resorts World Sentosa  
* GreenPac Pte Ltd  
* Applied Materials Singapore Operational Centre  
* Sheng Siong Supermarket  
* Singapore Sports Hub
