### SINGAPORE'S EMISSIONS PROFILE

Climate change is a global challenge that requires a global response. Despite the unique challenges and constraints faced as a dense built-up city-state with no hinterland and limited resources, we are committed to doing our part in the global fight against climate change.

Historically, our strategic position along the East-West trade routes has made Singapore a natural location for oil storage and refining facilities serving the region. Building on our position as a key regional port, the refining and petrochemical plants help create synergies and are part of a business supply network in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, South Asia and Australasia. Although the refining and petrochemical sector is a large source of our carbon emissions, energy efficiency improvement will remain a key strategy to reduce the industry sector's emissions.
