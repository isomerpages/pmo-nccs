<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>On 10 February 2025, Singapore announced that it would&nbsp;further reduce
its emissions to between <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/files/docs/default-source/news-documents/Singapore_Second_Nationally_Determined_Contribution.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">45 and 50 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e in 2035</a>,
as part of our 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). This builds
on our 2030 NDC to reduce emissions to around 60 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e by 2030,
after peaking emissions earlier. This is aligned with our <a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/files/docs/default-source/publications/nccsleds.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS)</a> to
achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore has always taken climate action seriously and we have always
emphasised on sustainable development. In 2009, we pledged to reduce our
emissions by 16% below BAU levels by 2020 ahead of the Copenhagen Summit.
Singapore achieved this pledge with a 32% reduction below BAU levels in
2020.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite Singapore’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nccs.gov.sg/singapores-climate-action/overview/national-circumstances/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">national circumstances</a>&nbsp;as
a resource-constrained and alternative energy-disadvantaged city-state,
we are committed to doing our part as a responsible member of the international
community. Our climate targets are ambitious and signals our resolve to
help our economy transform to stay competitive in a low-carbon world. &nbsp;Nevertheless,
our ability to fulfil our pledges, like all Parties, will depend on continued
international commitment by countries to deliver on their climate pledges.
The targets will also be contingent on the maturity of decarbonisation
technologies and effective international cooperation.</p>
