<h3>SINGAPORE'S EMISSIONS PROFILE</h3>
<p>Climate change is a global challenge that requires a global response.
Despite the <a href="/singapores-climate-action/overview/national-circumstances" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">unique challenges and constraints</a> Singapore
faces as a dense built-up city-state with no hinterland and limited resources,
we are committed to doing our part in the global fight against climate
change.</p>
<p>Historically, our strategic position along the East-West trade routes
has made Singapore a natural location for oil storage and refining facilities
serving the region. Building on our position as a key regional port, the
refining and petrochemical sector helps create synergies and is part of
a business supply network in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, South
Asia and Australasia. Although the refining and petrochemical sector remains
a significant proportion of our total carbon emissions, we are <a href="/singapores-climate-action/mitigation-efforts/overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">taking steps to reduce emissions</a>.</p>
