### [CLOSED ON 26 SEPT 2022] PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON SINGAPORE’S RAISED CLIMATE AMBITION

A public consultation exercise was launched from 5 – 26 Sept 2022 inviting members of the public to contribute views on how Singapore can work towards becoming a low-carbon country as we consider raising our long-term ambition to achieve net zero by 2050.

Climate change is a real and existential threat. Latest findings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Sixth Assessment Report assessed that the impacts of climate change are more apparent and will affect us more severely than previously thought. Although Singapore contributes only 0.1% of the global emissions, we are disproportionately affected by its effects as a low-lying island city state.

Building on Singapore’s long-standing emphasis on sustainable development, this decisive move to net zero will ensure that we do our part in the global fight against climate change. In addition, this move will position Singapore to take advantage of the positive global trends in sustainable financing and corporate net zero targets to make Singapore an attractive place for green economic activities in industry, services, and finance. In re-positioning our economy and establishing our competitive edge early, this will allow us to grow many good jobs for Singaporeans and enhance Singapore’s value proposition in the future low-carbon global economy.

We thank all the contributors to our public consultation exercise. We will publish a summary of the responses received on the REACH and National Climate Change Secretariat websites prior to any formal revision of Singapore’s Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) and 2030 National Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
