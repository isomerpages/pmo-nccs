The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) conducted an online public consultation through REACH on Singapore’s climate ambition from 5 to 26 September 2022. We received 490 responses from members of the public and representatives of businesses and NGOs. The breakdown by age group is shown in Figure 1. Prior to this public consultation exercise, the Government had engaged more than 1,200 stakeholders from various segments of society, including youths and representatives from businesses, green groups, academia and NGOs, under the Singapore Green Plan 2030.

**Climate Ambition**

3.             66% of all respondents felt that the proposed enhancement to Singapore’s climate ambition to achieve net-zero by 2050 was "not sufficiently ambitious”, while 26% agreed that it was “just right” (Figure 2). Those who indicated that Singapore was “not sufficiently ambitious” were asked to propose a suitable net-zero year. 126 respondents specified a year between 2040 and 2049. In response to the question on whether Singapore should enhance its NDC, 62% of the 304 <sup>[1]</sup> respondents that responded to the question agreed that there was scope to enhance Singapore’s 2030 NDC (Figure 3).
