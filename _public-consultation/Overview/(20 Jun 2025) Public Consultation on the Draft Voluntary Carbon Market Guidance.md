<h3>[20 JUN 2025] PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON DRAFT VOLUNTARY MARKET GUIDANCE</h3>
<p>The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS), the Ministry of Trade
and Industry (MTI), and Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) jointly issued
a draft guidance today on how companies can voluntarily use carbon credits
as part of a credible decarbonisation plan. The public is invited to provide
feedback on the draft guidance, and the public consultation period will
be from <strong>20 June 2025 to 20 July 2025</strong>. The draft guidance
can be found in Annex A.</p>
<p><strong><u>Background</u></strong>
</p>
<p>A carbon credit is a certificate representing the reduction or removal
of greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon markets, which facilitate the buying
and selling of carbon credits, are a critical enabler for the global transition
to net zero. They help to (i) channel capital to decarbonisation projects
that would have otherwise not occurred, especially in emerging markets
and developing economies; and (ii) provide companies a complementary tool
to meet their decarbonisation targets in the face of hard-to-abate emissions.
Entities may purchase carbon credits for compliance<sup>1</sup> or voluntary
purposes. Carbon credits used by companies to meet their voluntary climate
commitments are traded on the voluntary carbon market (VCM).</p>
<p>However, the growth of carbon markets has been constrained by a few factors.
One of the main challenges in the VCM is the lack of standardisation which
has led to confusion around various industry-led standards. This has undermined
market confidence and companies concerned about reputational risks are
holding back from the VCM. From industry engagements over the past year,
we have received feedback on the need for the government to provide guidance
on the VCM, including how companies can use carbon credits as part of a
credible decarbonisation plan and how to determine a high-quality carbon
credit.</p>
<p>In response to this industry feedback, NCCS, MTI and EnterpriseSG have
worked with the <a href="https://www.ssfa.org.sg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA)</a> and
industry partners across the carbon credit value chain to draft guidance
for companies looking to purchase carbon credits. The guidance:</p>
<p>(a) aligns to approaches that governments have agreed to adopt as buyers
of carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, where relevant;</p>
<p>(b) emphasises that carbon credits should have high environmental integrity;</p>
<p>(c) enjoins companies to prioritise all feasible abatement efforts before
considering the use of credits to address remaining emissions; and</p>
<p>(d) clarifies that corresponding adjustments do not apply to credits purchased
by companies looking to meet their voluntary climate commitments as these
credits are not counted towards Nationally Determined Contributions.</p>
<p>The draft guidance is part of the Singapore government’s broader strategy
to promote a vibrant, high-integrity carbon market. Key initiatives include:</p>
<p>(a) allowing carbon tax-liable companies to use eligible <a href="https://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Article 6-compliant carbon credits</a> to
offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions;</p>
<p>(b) requiring companies to disclose the role of carbon credits in their
decarbonisation strategy, as part of climate reporting requirements aligned
to the International Sustainability Standards Board;</p>
<p>(c) supporting access to high-quality Article 6 carbon credits through
the Carbon Project Development Grant;<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>(d) building a vibrant carbon services and trading ecosystem in Singapore,
comprising project developers, traders, advisory firms, and monitoring,
reporting and verification (MRV) services;</p>
<p>(e) rolling out capacity building opportunities for carbon projects in
the region; and</p>
<p>(f) engaging like-minded countries to provide consistent guidance to companies
on carbon credits.<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<p>The industry has also been taking been taking steps to grow the carbon
markets. For example, SSFA is surveying companies for a potential Claims
Guidance Code to complement the Singapore Government’s VCM guidance, and
is cooperating with regional carbon market associations under the ASEAN
Common Carbon Framework to support high-quality credit supply and demand
signals.</p>
<p><strong><u>Invitation to Provide Feedback</u></strong>
</p>
<p>NCCS, MTI and EnterpriseSG invite businesses and members of the public
to provide feedback on the scope and content of the draft VCM guidance
by <strong>20 July 2025</strong>. Feedback can be submitted via <a href="https://www.go.gov.sg/vcmguidance" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.go.gov.sg/vcmguidance</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><sup>1 </sup>Examples of compliance purposes include meeting regulatory
requirements and national commitments under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change.</p>
<p><sup>2 </sup>At COP29 in November 2024, the Economic Development Board
(EDB) launched the Carbon Project Development Grant to provide support
for leading project developers to originate early-stage Article-6 carbon
projects. The Temasek Trust Foundation Advisors is partnering EDB to crowd
in philanthropic capital for projects supported by the grant.</p>
<p><sup>3 </sup>Singapore will be co-leading an initiative to be announced
on 24 June 2025 during London Climate Action Week.</p>
