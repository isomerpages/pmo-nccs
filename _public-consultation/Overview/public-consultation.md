### PUBLIC CONSULTATION

##### Ongoing Consultations
Taking place from 8 Oct to 5 Nov 2024, NCCS has launched a public consultation on REACH Singapore to gather views on Singapore’s decarbonisation journey, including Singapore’s climate ambition, our transition towards a low-carbon economy and the decarbonisation measures we will undertake. The views will be taken into consideration as Singapore develops the next bound of climate targets, measures and policies.
