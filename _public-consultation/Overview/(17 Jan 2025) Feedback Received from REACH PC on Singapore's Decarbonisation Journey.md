The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) conducted an online public
consultation through REACH on Singapore’s decarbonisation journey from
8 October to 5 November 2024. We received 580 responses from members of
the public. The breakdown by age group is shown in Figure 1.</p>

The public consultation was not designed to representatively sample Singapore’s
population. Those who took an interest in climate change issues made up
96% of all respondents (Figure 2).</p>

A summary of the feedback from the public consultation can be found below.
The Government will take these into consideration as we develop the next
bound of Singapore’s climate targets, measures and policies.</p>

<p><strong>Climate Commitments</strong>
</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
91% of all respondents were supportive of Singapore’s goals to achieve
net zero emissions by 2050 (Figure 3).</p>

<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of those who were supportive of Singapore’s net zero target, 82% stated
that Singapore should further accelerate its transition to net zero, by
setting more ambitious climate targets (Figure 3). The two reasons that
respondents felt were most important to why they supported Singapore’s
net zero target were “we should do more so that our future generations
can have a more liveable environment” and “we should do more to reduce
the worst effects of climate change on ourselves” (Figure 4).</p>

For the 5% of respondents who did not support Singapore’s net zero target,
the two reasons that respondents felt were most important were cost to
individuals and effects on economic competitiveness (Figure 5).</p>

When asked about the behavioural changes they were willing to make, more
than 80% of all respondents selected “reduce usage of single-use plastic
bags and plastic straws”, “increase recycling”, and “increase walking,
cycling and use of public transport, while reducing driving and use of
private-hire vehicles”. Fewer than 50% of respondents selected “pay more
for low-carbon electricity”, “pay more for goods that emit more greenhouse
gases in their production”, and “reduce air travel” (Figure 6).</p>

<p><u>Summary of Related Qualitative Responses</u>
</p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some respondents urged Singapore to set more ambitious targets and decarbonise
faster. There were also suggestions for Singapore to be more transparent
in how we determine our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); these
include setting interim goals towards net zero, and reporting the progress
of decarbonisation measures. Other respondents stated that Singapore should
expend less resources combatting climate change and should instead focus
on lowering cost of living and ensuring economic competitiveness by lowering
business costs.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Transition</strong>
</p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
93% of all respondents agreed that it was important for Singapore to transition
to a low-carbon economy (Figure 7). Among respondents who were employed,
85% stated that they understood how a decarbonising economy affects the
competitiveness and operations of the industry they worked in (Figure 8),
and 68% stated that their company understood those effects (Figure 9).</p>

76% of all respondents agreed that the transition to a low-carbon economy
would generate good jobs for Singaporeans (Figure 10), and 65% felt that
they were aware of the skills that they needed to be competitive in a low-carbon
economy job market (Figure 11).</p>

On whether the Singapore Government has provided attractive incentives
to help companies decarbonise, 44% of all respondents agreed and 17% disagreed
(Figure 12). Among those who agreed, 57% disagreed that the Government
should scale back on those incentives. Within the same subgroup of respondents,
32% of those who were employed stated that their company currently taps
at least one of the available incentives to support its decarbonisation
efforts.</p>

Among those who disagreed that the Singapore Government has provided attractive
incentives to help companies decarbonise, only 35% were aware of the available
incentives companies could tap (Figure 13).</p>

</p>
<p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
77% of all respondents agreed that Singapore should put in place policies
that provide companies with stronger disincentives to emit carbon (Figure
14). Of those who agreed, 64% stated that they would pay more for the goods
and services of companies that decarbonised at a faster pace.</p>

<p><u>Summary of Related Qualitative Responses</u>
</p>
<p>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some respondents commented that Singapore should be an early mover in the
region to capture green jobs and economic opportunities, including being
a sustainability research and development hub. There should also be more
green skills programmes available at institutes of&nbsp;higher learning.
We should also consider a more circular economy and potentially slowing
down economic growth to reduce our environmental impact.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some respondents suggested that low-carbon goods should be priced lower
than higher-carbon alternatives to incentivise their consumption and to
ensure that cost of living does not increase. More incentives could be
provided to both companies and individuals to accelerate our decarbonisation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some respondents stated that more responsibility should be placed on industry
rather than individuals to adopt less emissive practices, and called on
corporates to do more. Companies should be held accountable to their climate
targets to prevent greenwashing and those tapping decarbonisation grants
should be more transparent on their sustainability plans. Singapore could
also extend grants to more companies and cover more areas of transition
planning such as measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of carbon
emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Decarbonisation Measures</strong>
</p>
<p>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For each decarbonisation measure, more than 75% of all respondents stated
that they understood what the measure entailed and how the measure contributed
to decarbonisation (Figure 15).</p>
