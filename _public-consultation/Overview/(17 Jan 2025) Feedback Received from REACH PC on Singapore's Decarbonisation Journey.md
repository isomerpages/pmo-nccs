The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) conducted an online public
consultation through REACH on Singapore’s decarbonisation journey from
8 October to 5 November 2024. We received 580 responses from members of
the public. The breakdown by age group is shown in Figure 1.</p>

The public consultation was not designed to representatively sample Singapore’s
population. Those who took an interest in climate change issues made up
96% of all respondents (Figure 2).</p>

<p><strong>Climate Commitments</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
91% of all respondents were supportive of Singapore’s goals to achieve
net zero emissions by 2050 (Figure 3).</p>

Of those who were supportive of Singapore’s net zero target, 82% stated
that Singapore should further accelerate its transition to net zero, by
setting more ambitious climate targets (Figure 3). The two reasons that
respondents felt were most important to why they supported Singapore’s
net zero target were “we should do more so that our future generations
can have a more liveable environment” and “we should do more to reduce
the worst effects of climate change on ourselves” (Figure 4).</p>

For the 5% of respondents who did not support Singapore’s net zero target,
the two reasons that respondents felt were most important were cost to
individuals and effects on economic competitiveness (Figure 5).&nbsp;</p>

When asked about the behavioural changes they were willing to make, more
than 80% of all respondents selected “reduce usage of single-use plastic
bags and plastic straws”, “increase recycling”, and “increase walking,
cycling and use of public transport, while reducing driving and use of
private-hire vehicles”. Fewer than 50% of respondents selected “pay more
for low-carbon electricity”, “pay more for goods that emit more greenhouse
gases in their production”, and “reduce air travel” (Figure 6).</p>

<p><u>Summary of Related Qualitative Responses</u>
</p>
<p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some respondents urged Singapore to set more ambitious targets and decarbonise
faster. There were also suggestions for Singapore to be more transparent
in how we determine our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); these
include setting interim goals towards net zero, and reporting the progress
of decarbonisation measures. Other respondents stated that Singapore should
expend less resources combatting climate change and should instead focus
on lowering cost of living and ensuring economic competitiveness by lowering
business costs.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Economic Transition</strong>
</p>
<p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
93% of all respondents agreed that it was important for Singapore to transition
to a low-carbon economy (Figure 7). Among respondents who were employed,
85% stated that they understood how a decarbonising economy affects the
competitiveness and operations of the industry they worked in (Figure 8),
and 68% stated that their company understood those effects (Figure 9).</p>

76% of all respondents agreed that the transition to a low-carbon economy
would generate good jobs for Singaporeans (Figure 10), and 65% felt that
they were aware of the skills that they needed to be competitive in a low-carbon
economy job market (Figure 11).</p>

<p>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On whether the Singapore Government has provided attractive incentives
to help companies decarbonise, 44% of all respondents agreed and 17% disagreed
(Figure 12). Among those who agreed, 57% disagreed that the Government
should scale back on those incentives. Within the same subgroup of respondents,
32% of those who were employed stated that their company currently taps
at least one of the available incentives to support its decarbonisation
efforts.</p>

Among those who disagreed that the Singapore Government has provided attractive
incentives to help companies decarbonise, only 35% were aware of the available
incentives companies could tap (Figure 13).</p>
<p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
77% of all respondents agreed that Singapore should put in place policies
that provide companies with stronger disincentives to emit carbon (Figure
14). Of those who agreed, 64% stated that they would pay more for the goods
and services of companies that decarbonised at a faster pace.</p>

<p><u>Summary of Related Qualitative Responses</u>
</p>
<p>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some respondents commented that Singapore should be an early mover in the
region to capture green jobs and economic opportunities, including being
a sustainability research and development hub. There should also be more
green skills programmes available at institutes for higher learning. We
should also consider a more circular economy and potentially slowing down
economic growth to reduce our environmental impact.</p>
<p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some respondents suggested that low-carbon goods should be priced lower
than higher-carbon alternatives to incentivise their consumption and to
ensure that cost of living does not increase. More incentives could be
provided to both companies and individuals to accelerate our decarbonisation.</p>
<p>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some respondents stated that more responsibility should be placed on industry
rather than individuals to adopt less emissive practices, and called on
corporates to do more. Companies should be held accountable to their climate
targets to prevent greenwashing and those tapping decarbonisation grants
should be more transparent on their sustainability plans. Singapore could
also extend grants to more companies and cover more areas of transition
planning such as measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of carbon
emissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Decarbonisation Measures</strong>
</p>
<p>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For each decarbonisation measure, more than 75% of all respondents stated
that they understood what the measure entailed and how the measure contributed
to decarbonisation (Figure 15).</p>

<p>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For each decarbonisation measure, more than 55% of all respondents stated
that they supported the adoption of the measure as part of Singapore’s
transition to net zero (Figure 16). More than 85% of all respondents indicated
their support for solar deployment, minimum energy performance standards,
and industry energy efficiency measures.</p>

willing to pay more for goods and services as a result of the carbon tax
(Figure 17).</p>

<p><u>Summary of Related Qualitative Responses</u>
</p>
<p>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Carbon tax</em>.
Respondents generally supported the carbon tax as a tool to incentivise
decarbonisation. Some suggested that the carbon tax level could increase
and the taxable emissions threshold lowered. The impact of the carbon tax
should not be lessened by the provision of allowances to companies, and
there should be more transparency regarding how allowances are allocated.
Revenue from the carbon tax should be channelled back to citizens, particularly
to support lower income households in dealing with the costs associated
with decarbonisation. The carbon tax should also be implemented alongside
other measures for greater effectiveness. Other respondents were against
the carbon tax as they stated that it increased the cost of living.</p>
<p>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Importing low-carbon electricity</em>.
Some respondents commented that, when pursuing electricity imports projects,
the Government should consider social, economic and environmental impacts
on the source countries. The electricity imported should also be from a
fully renewable energy source. Other respondents stated that Singapore
should not be overly dependent on electricity imports. Reasons highlighted
include cost, security and intermittency.</p>
<p>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Carbon capture and storage (CCS)</em>.
Some respondents stated that CCS should be limited to hard-to-abate sectors
and should not be an easy way out to prolong or even increase the use of
fossil fuels. CCS should also be coupled with measures to reduce carbon
emissions, and should not cause detriment to the host countries of storage
sites. Respondents also stated that Singapore should explore direct air
capture and other carbon removal solutions. Other respondents stated that
CCS might not be fully technologically proven and were concerned about
scalability.</p>
<p>23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Carbon credits</em>.
Some respondents stated that regulations should be imposed to ensure that
the carbon credits used by Singapore were of high integrity and should
not be to the detriment of the source country. Singapore should expand
the countries we were working with on carbon credits as it is a useful
way to overcome our national circumstances. Respondents also commented
that companies should not be allowed to use carbon credits as a way to
pay their way out of decarbonisation, and their use should be accompanied
by plans to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
<p>24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Solar deployment</em>.
Respondents suggested that Singapore should maximise our domestic solar
deployment and subsidise the installation of solar panels on private rooftops.
Other respondents stated that they were concerned about the materials used
in the production of solar panels as well as their end-of-life treatment
and disposal.</p>
<p>25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Energy</em>.
Respondents stated that as Singapore decarbonises our grid, we should also
work to reduce energy demand. We could provide incentives to reduce energy
consumption during peak periods and consider the use of long-duration energy
storage systems. Energy demand from cooling can also be reduced by increase
in the temperatures in malls, offices and public transportation, as well
as through effective building design. Singapore could also reconsider siting
data centres here as they were energy intensive. Other respondents stated
that Singapore should also explore other forms of power generation, such
as nuclear, through small modular reactors, green hydrogen, wind and hydroelectricity.</p>
<p>26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Transport</em>.
Respondents stated that electric vehicles (EVs) should be further subsidised
and infrastructure supporting EVs should be improved. Internal combustion
engine (ICE) vehicles should also be further regulated, and Singapore should
move towards reducing the number of private vehicles overall. Walk, cycle
and ride should be further encouraged by improving public transportation
and developing better infrastructure to encourage cycling. Other respondents
stated that switching to EVs at this time would increase electricity demand
before our energy mix is fully renewable. EVs could also require the use
of unsustainable materials in their production, particularly for batteries</p>
<p>27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Waste</em>.
Respondents stated that more should be done to reduce waste and increase
our recycling rate, particularly to reduce our reliance on single-use plastics.</p>
<p>28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Forestry and agriculture</em>.
Respondents stated that Singapore should avoid deforestation and explore
nature-based climate solutions. We should also promote eating less meat
and consider how food production can be more sustainable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Other Qualitative Responses</strong>
</p>
<p>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Education</em>.
Respondents stated that the public should be educated more on climate change
as well as Singapore’s decarbonisation efforts. Behavioural change should
be encouraged from a young age through schools. Consumer behaviour can
also be changed with the implementation of behavioural nudges.</p>
<p>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Public consultation</em>.
Respondents stated that they hoped for more consultations and engagements
with the public on climate change. They suggested more open-ended questions
as well as questions on areas for improvement for each decarbonisation
measure. Future public consultations could also cover nuclear energy and
adaptation measures.</p>
