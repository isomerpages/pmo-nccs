### [CLOSED ON 30 SEPT 2019]: PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON DEVELOPING SINGAPORE'S LONG-TERM LOW EMISSIONS STRATEGY


The global climate situation is changing. Extreme weather events are expected to be more intense and frequent, and global mean sea levels are projected to rise.

As a small, low-lying island city-state, Singapore is especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Rising sea levels, changes to our rainfall patterns, and increasing temperatures will affect our health, water supply, biodiversity and greenery, and coastline, among other things.  It is thus imperative for us to work with the international community to address this urgent global problem. Singapore needs to do our part by further reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and embark on a transition to a low-carbon future.

A [<a href="/docs/default-source/default-document-library/2050-public-consultation-document-(for-publication)_(revised-151019).pdf" target="_blank">public consultation exercise</a>](/docs/default-source/default-document-library/2050-public-consultation-document-(for-publication)_(revised-151019).pdf) was launched from 16 Jul to 30 Sept 2019 on Singapore's low carbon emissions strategy beyond 2030. It aims to seek views on measures and actions that can be taken by the Government, businesses, households, and individuals towards becoming a low carbon global city-state.

We thank all the contributors to our public consultation exercise. We will publish a summary of the responses received on the REACH and National Climate Change Secretariat websites in the first quarter of 2020.
