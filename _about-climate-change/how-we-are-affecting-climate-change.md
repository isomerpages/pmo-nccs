### HOW WE ARE AFFECTING CLIMATE CHANGE

**The Greenhouse Effect**

The greenhouse effect occurs naturally when heat from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), which are naturally present in the air. These gases allow the Earth's atmosphere to be warm enough to support life.

However, the burning of fossil fuels for energy, industrial production and the clearing of forests to raise livestock have increased the production of GHGs. These additional GHGs trap even more heat in the atmosphere, making the Earth warmer.

Based on the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâ€™s (IPCC) Working Group I Sixth Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/) (released in August 2021)  , the global atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration stood at 410 parts per million (ppm) in 2019 and increased at approximately 2.4 ppm per year from 2011 to 2019.

**The Enhanced Greenhouse Effect**
