### GLOBAL IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE

The Earth's air, water and land are all linked to the climate. Any small increase in global average temperature over an extended period can trigger a chain reaction of climatic change around the world. Less rain can lead to drought, while too much rain can lead to flooding. More hot days during the year can dry up crops and affect people, plants and animals. In many places, people will struggle to cope with the changing environment.

According to the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Working Group I Sixth Assessment Report ](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/)(released on 6 August 2021), world average surface temperatures could increase by 1.0°C to 5.7°C by the end of this century. The rate of global mean sea level rise has accelerated and will continue throughout the 21st century, ranging from 0.32m to 1.01m.

2024 was the warmest year on record for Singapore, tied with 2019 and 2016. All months recorded temperatures that were equal to or above their respective long-term averages. July 2024 was the warmest month on record, during which Singapore also experience a dry spell from 13 to 30 July 2024.

### Global Consequences
Climate change has grave consequences on a global scale because the temperature increase directly impacts the sustainability of water, food supplies, ecosystems, coastal stability and public health.
